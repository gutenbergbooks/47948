<h2>TO THE MOST HONOURABLE<br />

THE MARQUESS OF BREADALBANE, <span class="smcap">Kt.</span>,<br />

PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF SCOTLAND.</h2>


<p>
<span class="smcap">My Lord Marquess</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>In presenting to my fellow-countrymen a Work devoted to
the elucidation of their National Antiquities, and to the recovery of
the earliest traces of Scottish arts and civilisation, I esteem it a high
gratification to be permitted to dedicate it to a Scotsman, not more
noble by hereditary rank and social position, than by the virtues
with which he adorns his high station.</p>

<p>To you, <span class="smcap">My Lord</span>, I have reason to believe that the following
attempt to establish a consistent and comprehensive system of Scottish
Archæology will not be without interest, as the zeal shewn by
you in furthering the objects of the Society of which you are President,
and the costly donations with which you have enriched its
collections, prove the value you attach to the Science as a key to the
discovery of important truths.</p>

<p class="center">I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">My Lord Marquess</span>,</p>

<p class="right">Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="right">DANIEL WILSON.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The zeal for Archæological investigation which has recently
manifested itself in nearly every country of Europe, has been
traced, not without reason, to the impulse which proceeded
from Abbotsford. Though such is not exactly the source
which we might expect to give birth to the transition from
profitless dilettantism to the intelligent spirit of scientific investigation,
yet it is unquestionable that Sir Walter Scott was
the first of modern writers "to teach all men this truth,
which looks like a truism, and yet was as good as unknown to
writers of history and others, till so taught,&mdash;that the bygone
ages of the world were actually filled by living men."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If,
however, the impulse to the pursuit of Archæology as a science
be thus traceable to our own country, neither Scotland nor
England can lay claim to the merit of having been the first to
recognise its true character, or to develop its fruits. The
spirit of antiquarianism has not, indeed, slumbered among us.
It has taken form in Roxburgh, Bannatyne, Abbotsford, and
other literary Clubs, producing valuable results for the use of
the historian, but limiting its range within the Medieval era,
and abandoning to isolated labourers that ampler field of
research which embraces the prehistoric period of nations, and
belongs not to literature but to the science of Nature. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>not till continental Archæologists had shewn what legitimate
induction is capable of, that those of Britain were content to
forsake laborious trifling, and associate themselves with renewed
energy of purpose to establish the study on its true footing as
an indispensable link in the circle of the sciences.</p>

<p>Amid the increasing zeal for the advancement of knowledge,
the time appears to have at length come for the thorough elucidation
of Primeval Archæology as an element in the history
of man. The British Association, expressly constituted for the
purpose of giving a stronger impulse and a more systematic
direction to scientific inquiry, embraced within its original
scheme no provision for the encouragement of those investigations
which most directly tend to throw light on the origin and
progress of the human race. Physical archæology was indeed
admissible, in so far as it dealt with the extinct fauna of the
palæontologist; but it was practically pronounced to be without
the scientific pale whenever it touched on that portion of the
archæology of the globe which comprehends the history of the
race of human beings to which we ourselves belong. A delusive
hope was indeed raised by the publication in the first
volume of the Transactions of the Association, of one memoir
on the contributions afforded by physical and philological researches
to the history of the human species,&mdash;but the ethnologist
was doomed to disappointment. During several annual meetings,
elaborate and valuable memoirs, prepared on various
questions relating to this important branch of knowledge, and
to the primeval population of the British Isles, were returned
to their authors without being read. This pregnant fact has
excited little notice hitherto; but when the scientific history of
the first half of the nineteenth century shall come to be reviewed
by those who succeed us, and reap the fruits of such
advancement as we now aim at, it will not be overlooked as an
evidence of the exoteric character of much of the overestimated
science of the age. Through the persevering zeal of a few resolute
men of distinguished ability, ethnology was at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
afforded a partial footing among the recognised sciences, and
at the meeting of the Association to be held at Ipswich in
1851, it will for the first time take its place as a distinct section
of British Science.</p>

<p>It has fared otherwise with Archæology. Rejected in its
first appeal for a place among the sister sciences, its promoters
felt themselves under no necessity to court a share in popular
favour which they could readily command, and we have accordingly
its annual congresses altogether apart from those of the
associated sciences. Archæology, however, has suffered from
the isolation; while it cannot but be sooner or later felt to be
an inconsistency at once anomalous and pregnant with evil,
which recognises as a legitimate branch of British science, the
study of the human species, by means both of physiological
and philological investigation, but altogether excludes the
equally direct evidence which Archæology supplies. It rests,
however, with the archæologist to assert for his own study its
just place among the essential elements of scientific induction,
and to shew that it not only furnishes valuable auxiliary truth
in aid of physiological and philological comparisons, but that
it adds distinct psychological indices by no other means
attainable, and yields the most trustworthy, if not the sole
evidence in relation to extinct branches of the human family,
the history of which possesses a peculiar national and personal
interest for us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the close relations which subsist between the researches
of the ethnologist and the archæologist, and the perfect
unity of their aims, have been recognised by Nillson, Eschricht,
and other distinguished men in various countries; and while
the two sciences have advanced together, in harmony and with
mutual advantage, Scandinavian archæologists have given an
impetus to the study of Primitive Antiquities, which has already
done much to establish its value as the indispensable basis of all
written history. The facilities afforded to the Scandinavian
archæologist by the purity of his primitive remains, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
freedom of his ethnographic chronicles from those violent intercalations
of foreign elements which render both the ethnology
and the historical antiquities of Central Europe so complicated
and difficult of solution, peculiarly fitted him for originating a
comprehensive yet well-defined system. The comparatively
recent close of the Scandinavian primitive periods has preserved
in a more complete form those evidences by which we
recover the knowledge of the first rude colonists of Europe,
whose records are distorted and nearly effaced within the
wide pale of Roman sway. The isolation, moreover, of these
northern kingdoms preserved them from being the mere highway
of the first Asiatic nomades. Whatever traces of early
wanderers they retain are well-defined, so that to them we
may look for clear and satisfactory evidence in illustration of
one portion at least of the primal north-western tide of migration
from which the origin of all European history dates. It
chances, however, from various accidental causes, that the revival
of archæological research in Britain, influenced by canons
directly supplied from Scandinavian sources, has a tendency to
authenticate some of the most favourite errors of older British
antiquaries. Based, as nearly all antiquarian pursuits in this
country have heretofore been, on classical learning, it has been
accepted as an almost indisputable truth, that, with the exception
of the mysteriously learned Druid priests, the Britons prior
to the Roman Period were mere painted savages. Hence,
while the artless relics of our primeval Stone Period were
generally assigned to native workmanship, whatever evinced
any remarkable traces of skill distinct from the well-defined
Roman art, was assumed of necessity to have a foreign origin,
and was usually ascribed to the Danes. The invariable adoption
of the latter term in preference to that of Norwegians or
Norsemen, shews how completely Scottish and Irish antiquaries
have abandoned themselves to the influence of English literature,
even where the appropriation of its dogmas was opposed
to well-known historical facts. The name of Dane has in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
for centuries been one of those convenient words which so often
take the place of ideas and save the trouble and inconvenience of
reasoning. Yet this theory of a Danish origin for nearly all native
arts, though adopted without investigation, and fostered in
defiance of evidence, has long ceased to be a mere popular error.
It pervades both the Scottish and English Archæologiæ, and the
great majority of works on every department of British antiquities,
and has till recently proved a perpetual stumblingblock
to the Irish antiquary. It is, moreover, a cumulative error,&mdash;certain
Scottish relics, for example, found in Argyleshire, as
well as others in the Isle of Man, being assumed in the
Archæologia Scotica to be Scandinavian,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> an able writer in
the Transactions of the Cambridge Camden Society, taking
these assumptions as indisputable facts, employs them in proving
that other equally undoubted native works of art are also
Scandinavian.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So, too, a writer in the Archæologia Scotica,
ascribing a similar origin to the monolithic structures of the
Orkney and Shetland Islands,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is quoted by Danish antiquaries<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
as referring to an established truth, and as proving,
accordingly, that similar structures in the Hebrides are also
the work of the Northmen! Pennant, Chalmers, Barry, Macculloch,
Scott, Hibbert, and a host of other writers might be
quoted to shew how this theory, like a snow-ball, gathers as it
rolls, taking up indiscriminately whatever chances to lie in its
erratic course. Even the poets have lent their aid to propagate
the same prevalent error. Cowper, for example,&mdash;no uneducated
or superficial writer,&mdash;thus strangely postdates Britain's
birth-time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now borne upon the wings of truth sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Review thy dim original and prime,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This island, spot of unreclaimed rude earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cradle that received thee at thy birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rocked by many a rough Norwegian blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Danish howlings scared thee as they past."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar examples of the influence of this predominant theory
might be multiplied from the most diverse sources; nor are
even the recently established archæological periodicals free
from it. It is obvious, therefore, that such opinions must be
sifted to the utmost, and either established or got rid of before
any efficient progress can be made in British Archæology. In
Scotland this theory is much more comprehensive in its effects
than in England, where the Anglo-Saxon element is recognised
as the predominating source of later changes; and now that
the character of genuine Roman antiquities is well ascertained,
nearly the whole of our native relics have latterly been assigned
to a Scandinavian origin. It is altogether unnecessary,
I trust, to disclaim any petty spirit of national jealousy in the
rigorous investigation of such theories which will be found pursued
in the following pages. The error is for the most part of
native growth; but whencesoever it be derived, truth is the
end which the archæologist has in view; and the enlightened
spirit in which the researches of the Northern antiquaries have
already been pursued, is the best guarantee that they will not
be less ready to co-operate in overturning error than in establishing
truth. It is not a mere question between Northman
or Dane and Celt or Saxon. It involves the entire chronology
of the prehistoric British periods, and so long as it remains
unsettled any consistent arrangement of our archæological data
into a historical sequence is impossible.</p>

<p>The following work, embracing within its plan such a comprehensive
scheme of Scottish Archæology as has not been
hitherto attempted, has been undertaken under the conviction
that this science is the key to great truths which have yet to
be reached, and that its importance will hereafter be recognised
in a way little dreamt of by those students of kindred sciences,
who, while busied in investigating the traces of older but inferior
orders of being, can discern only the objects of an aimless
curiosity in relics pertaining to the human species. That such,
however, should still be the case, is far more the fault of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
antiquary than of the student of other sciences. It is his misfortune
that his most recondite pursuits are peculiarly exposed to
the laborious idling of the mere dabblers in science, so that they
alternately assume to the uninterested observer the aspect of
frivolous pastime and of solemn trifling. I cannot but think
that a direct union with the associated sciences, and an incorporation
especially with the kindred researches of the ethnologist,
while it might, perchance, give some of its present admirers
a distaste for the severer and more restricted study, would
largely contribute to its real advancement, and free its truly
zealous students from many popular trammels which at present
cumber its progress. Meanwhile the archæologist may derive
some hope from the remembrance that astronomy was once
astrology; that chemistry was long mere alchemy; that geology
has only in our own day ceased to be a branch of unreasoning
antiquarianism; and that ethnology has scarcely yet passed the
jealously guarded porch, as the youngest of all the recognised
band of sister sciences.</p>

<p>In nothing is the want of the intelligent cooperation of the
kindred sciences which bear on the study of antiquities more
apparent than in the present state of our public collections. The
British Museum contains the elements of a collection which, if
arranged ethnographically and chronologically, would form the
most valuable school of popular instruction that Government could
establish; and no other country rests under the same manifest
duty to form a complete ethnological museum as Britain: with
her hundred colonies, and her tribes of subject aborigines in
every quarter of the globe, losing their individuality where they
escape extinction, by absorption and assimilation to their European
masters. Were an entire quadrangular range of apartments
in the British Museum devoted to a continuous systematic
arrangement, the visitor should pass from the ethnographic
rooms, shewing man as he is still found in the primitive savage
state, and destitute of the metallurgic arts; thence to the relics
of the Stone Period, not of Britain or Europe only; but also of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Asia, Africa, and America, including the remarkable primitive
traces which even Egypt discloses. To this would then fitly
succeed the old monuments of Egyptian civilisation, the Nimrud
marbles, the sculptures of India, and all the other evidences of
early Asiatic arts. The Archaic Greek and Colonial works
should come after these, followed by the master-pieces of the age
of Pericles, and these again by the monuments of imperial Rome.
Thus by a natural sequence we return to British remains: the
Anglo-Roman relics piecing on like a new chapter of European
history, at the point where our island first appears as a part of
the old Roman world, and followed in succession by our native
Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian, Norman, and Medieval antiquities.
The materials for all this, if we except the primitive British relics,
are already acquired; and while to the thousands who annually
throng the Museum, in idle and profitless wonder, this would at
once convert into intelligible history, what must now be to the
vast majority of visitors a confused assortment of nearly meaningless
relics, even the most profound scholar might derive
from it information and pleasure, such as would amply repay
the labour of re-arrangement. The immense practical value
of collections to the archæologist renders their proper arrangement
a matter of grave importance, and one which cannot be
allowed to rest in its present extremely imperfect state.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland no national collection exists, though a small body
of zealous men have struggled to maintain an Archæological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
Museum in the Scottish capital for the last seventy years, in
defiance of obstacles of the most harassing nature. Not the
least of these is the enforcement of the law of treasure-trove, by
which all objects of the precious metals are held to be the property
of the Crown. Notwithstanding the earnest zeal for the
preservation of national relics which has actuated both Sir
Henry Jardine and John Henderson, Esq., the late and present
Crown and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancers for Scotland, and
the liberal construction of the law by its administrators, as
shewn in their offer of full value for all objects of the precious
metals which may be delivered up to them, its operation has
constantly impeded researches into the evidences of primitive
art, and in many cases has occasioned the destruction of very
valuable relics.</p>

<p>In a letter on this subject with which I have been favoured
by the distinguished Danish antiquary, Mr. J. J. A. Worsaae,
he remarks: "In Denmark, in former times, all hidden treasures,
when found, belonged to the king. They were called
<i>Danefa</i>. The finder had to give them up to the Crown without
any remuneration. The effect of this was that very few or no
antiquities of gold or silver were preserved for the Museum, [of
Northern Antiquities at Copenhagen,] as the finders secretly
sold the antiquities. For the purpose of putting an end to
this, a law was passed in the middle of last century, in which
the king declared himself willing to give the full value to the
finders, and in some cases still more than the value; but, at
the same time, he ordered all such things to be given up to the
public museums, and in case of concealment the finders were to
be tried and punished.</p>

<p>"This law is still in operation. It is the rule that <i>the finder</i>,
in the strictest sense of the word, gets the remuneration, as the
king&mdash;the real owner&mdash;has renounced his rights to him. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>owner of the soil only gets the value if he has ordered a servant
expressly to dig for any such thing, or, of course, if he is the
finder himself. This has proved most effective. Another measure
which has secured a good many objects for the Museum is
the payment of the finder <i>as soon as possible</i>. Poor people, as
the finders generally are, do not like to wait for money. They
get easily anxious, and prefer to sell the things for a smaller
price, if they only get the money without delay. It has now
come to this here, that very few antiquities of gold or silver are
lost. The peasants and workmen are perfectly well aware that
they get more for the things dug up, at the Museum in Copenhagen,
than in the shop of a goldsmith. This has been effected
by publication in the almanacs, newspapers, &amp;c., of the payments
given to finders of valuable antiquities."</p>

<p>Some of the wretched fruits of the different system still pursued
in this country are referred to in the following pages;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> yet
with the earnest desire of the officers of the Scottish Exchequer,
to whom the enforcement of the present law is committed, to
avert, if possible, the destructive consequences which it has
heretofore operated to produce, it is manifest that nothing more
is needed than to adopt the essential practical feature in the
Danish plan, which gives the actual finder the sole claim to
reward, and also holds him responsible and liable to punishment.
Until this indispensable change is effected, the Scottish archæologist
must continue to deplore the annual destruction of national
treasures, not less valuable to the historian than the chartularies
which are being rescued with so much labour and cost
from their long-neglected repositories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>In attempting to arrange the elements of a system of Scottish
Archæology, as a means towards the elucidation of prehistoric
annals, I have had frequently to regret the want of any national
collection adequate to the object in view. That the Museum of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland is one of considerable
value must I think be apparent, even from the materials it has
furnished for this volume. Some private collections, it will be
seen, add a few more to the rescued waifs of Scottish national
antiquities; but the result of an extensive correspondence carried
on with a view to obtain the necessary facts which no books at
present supply, has forced on me the conviction that, even within
the last dozen years, such a number of valuable objects have
been destroyed as would alone have formed an important nucleus
for a complete Archæological Museum. The new Statistical
Accounts, along with some periodicals and other recently published
works, contain references to discoveries made within that
period in nearly every district of Scotland. From these I
selected upwards of two hundred of the most interesting and
valuable examples, and the result of a laborious correspondence
is, the establishment of the fact that scarcely five per cent. of
the whole can now be ascertained to be in existence. Some have
been lost or broken; some thrown away, sold, or stolen,&mdash;which
in the case of objects of the precious metals involves their absolute
destruction; in other cases, the proprietors themselves
have disappeared&mdash;gone to India, America, Australia, or no one
knows where. Of the few that remain, the jealous fear which
the operation of the present law of treasure-trove excites has
rendered a portion inaccessible, so that a sufficiently meagre
handful of so prominent a harvest was left to be reaped.</p>

<p>When it is considered that in Scotland we have no such
treasuries of the facts on which an archæological system must
be built, as the Archæologia, the Vetusta Monumenta, the
Nenia Britannica, the Ancient Wiltshire, and a host of other
works supply to the English antiquary, I have a right to expect
that some forbearance be shewn in contrasting this first attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
at a comprehensive treatment of the subject, with the works
which other countries possess. I do not desire to offer it to
the reader with an apology, or to seek to deprecate criticism by
setting forth in array a host of difficulties surmounted or succumbed
to. It has been the work of such leisure time as could
be snatched from less congenial but engrossing pursuits, and
will probably be found to contain some recurrence to the same
ideas, to which a writer is liable when only able to take up
his theme at intervals, and to pursue it amid repeated interruptions.
Nevertheless, I have aimed at treating the subject
as one which I esteem a worthy one ought to be treated, and
if unsuccessful, it is not for want of the zeal which earnest
enthusiasm commands. Some new ground I believe has been
broken in the search after truth, and as a pioneer I am fully
prepared to see my footsteps erased by those who follow me.
It will be found, however, that truth is the goal which has been
aimed at; and if it be but as a glimmering that light appears,
it is well, so that its streaks are in the east, and the clouds which
begin to break make way before the dawn.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to acknowledge some of the many
favours received in the progress of the Work; though it is impossible
to mention all to whose liberality I have been indebted
during the extensive correspondence into which I was led while
collecting needful materials for substantiating the positions assumed
in the following argument. The want of such resources
as in other countries supply to the Archæologist the means of
constructing a system based on trustworthy evidence, has compelled
me to draw largely on the courtesy of private collectors;
and with very few exceptions, the cordial response returned to
my applications has rendered the otherwise irksome task a
source of pleasure, and even in some cases the beginning of
valued friendships.</p>

<p>The Council of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland have
afforded the utmost facilities in regard to their important national
collection, and have accorded to me an equal freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
in the use of the extensive correspondence preserved in their
Library, from which it will be found that some curious information
has been recovered, not otherwise attainable. From
my fellow Associates in the Society I have also received the
most hearty sympathy and cooperation. To the kind services
of Sir James Ramsay, Bart., I am indebted for obtaining from
Lady Menzies one of the beautiful gold relics figured in the
work. To my friend Professor J. Y. Simpson, M.D., I owe the
contribution of one of the illustrations, and to Albert Way, Esq.,
and George Seton, Esq., others of the woodcuts, presented to
me as the expression of their interest in my labours; while I
have to thank my friend James Drummond, Esq., A.R.S.A., for
drawings from his faithful pencil of several of the examples of
ancient Scottish arms, as well as of other relics figured in the
work. The many obligations I owe to the freedom with which
Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq., has long permitted me to
avail myself of the treasures of his extensive collection, will
appear in some degree from the use made of them in the following
pages; while John Bell, Esq. of Dungannon, has obviated
the difficulties which would have prevented my turning
his no less valuable archæological treasures to account, by forwarding
to me drawings and descriptions, from which some
portions of this work derive their chief interest. Others of the
objects selected for illustration are from the collection of
W. B. Johnstone, Esq., R.S.A., the whole rare and costly contents
of which have been placed completely at my disposal.</p>

<p>Nor must I omit to acknowledge the kind assistance I have
received in various ways from David Laing, Esq., William
B. D. D. Turnbull, Esq., W. H. Fotheringham, Esq., the Rev.,
James Mather, J. M. Mitchell, Esq., William Marshall, Esq.,
as well as from other Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland.</p>

<p>The Council of the Archæological Institute, with a liberality
altogether spontaneous, offered, in the most gratifying and flattering
terms of cordial sympathy with the object of my work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
the beautiful series of engravings of the Norrie's Law silver
relics, which illustrate the account of that remarkable discovery.</p>

<p>The Council of the British Archæological Association have
placed me under similar obligations in regard to the woodcuts
which illustrate the sepulchral discoveries at Pier-o-waal in
Orkney.</p>

<p>To Sir George Clerk, Bart., I owe the privilege of access to
the valuable and highly interesting collection of British and
Roman antiquities at Penicuick House, formed by the eminent
Scottish antiquary Sir John Clerk.</p>

<p>The very great obligations I am under to Lieutenant F.
W. L. Thomas, R.N., are repeatedly noticed in the following
pages, though in no degree adequately to the generosity with
which the knowledge acquired by him during his professional
exploration of the Orkney Islands, while engaged in the Admiralty
Survey, has been placed at my disposal.</p>

<p>I have also to acknowledge the contribution of valuable information
from my friend Professor Munch of Christiania, and
from George Petrie, Esq. of Kirkwall; as well as kind services
rendered me in various ways by Charles Roach Smith, Esq.,
J. C. Brown, Esq., William Nelson, Esq., by my indefatigable
friend and correspondent, John Buchanan, Esq. of Glasgow,
and others referred to in the course of the work.</p>

<p>My special thanks are due to Robert Hunter, of Hunterston,
Esq., for his courteous liberality in forwarding to me the valuable
Scottish relic found on his estate&mdash;engraved as the frontispiece
to this volume&mdash;after I had despaired of making anything
of its remarkable Runic inscription from various copies obligingly
furnished. Whatever opinion may be formed as to the value
of the interpretation of its inscription offered here, the archæologist
and philologist may both place the utmost reliance on the
fidelity of the engraved fac-simile of this interesting monument
of the palæography, and, as I believe also, of the language of
our ancestors. Besides putting into the engraver's hands a carefully
executed drawing, he had the advantage of having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
brooch itself before him while engraving it; after which I went
over the copy in his presence, comparing it letter by letter, and
checking the minutest deviations from the original. It is justly
remarked in the "Guide to Northern Archæology," that "in
copying Runic inscriptions great accuracy is required; for a
point, a small, scarcely perceptible line, changes the value of
the letter, or occasionally adds a letter, which may easily escape
notice." When, however, it is added that "one of the best
helps in copying Runic, and indeed all other inscriptions, is a
knowledge of the language in which they are written," I am inclined
to question its strict justice. Most authors, I believe,
who have had any experience of the matter, would much prefer
a compositor entirely ignorant of the language for setting up
Latin, or any foreign tongue, at least to one short of being a
perfect master of it. Where there is the total absence of knowledge
of it, the imagination is entirely at rest; and the patient
copying of letter after letter ensures the accuracy which often
surprises the young author when revising his first proofs. Even
so I would, in most cases, place more faith in the version of an
inscription by an engraver accustomed to accurate copying,
though entirely ignorant of the language, than in that of the
ablest philologist, with his head full of speculations as to its
meaning. A direct example in point is found in the Cardonell
or "Thorkelin" print of the Ruthwell inscriptions, where the
Scottish antiquary has given a more faithful version of the
Runic than of the Latin legends. Notwithstanding the extravagant
flights which Professor Finn Magnusen permitted his
imagination to take relative to the supposed personages named
on the Hunterston brooch, little blame can attach to him for
having missed its true meaning with nothing but imperfect copies
to guide him; but the fact that this inscription should have
been copied from the original brooch by two Scandinavian
scholars familiar with the Runic alphabet, without either of
them detecting the name <i>Maolfridi</i>, so palpably engraved on it,
proves how completely, though unconsciously, they were blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
by their knowledge of the old Norse language, and their belief
that it must contain the word <i>Dalkr</i>, a brooch. The recognition,
indeed, of this proper name proved to me the key to the
whole inscription, as it immediately suggested the probability of
the &#5850;&#5812; of former translators in the first line being also an &#5833;,
and so led to a new and intelligible reading of the remainder.
The word <i>d&igrave;ol</i>, which I have rendered according to its significance
as a substantive, is also employed as the verb <i>to avenge</i>.
One Gaelic scholar to whom I shewed the inscription, accordingly
suggested as a more characteristic old Celtic interpretation
of the Runes: <i>O Malbritha, thou friend, avenge Malfridi!</i>
"The difference," he adds, "between the ancient and
modern orthography is not greater than frequently exists between
the present spelling of familiar terms, as written or pronounced
in two contiguous Highland districts."</p>

<p>It is a customary conclusion to a preface to crave the forbearance
of the reader for all faults and shortcomings: the
which, as readers and critics make an equally general custom of
paying no attention to it, may as well be omitted. I can only
say, that while writing this work with an honest and earnest
desire for the discovery of truth, I have done it no less under
the conviction that anything I could now set forth on the subject
must be modified by more extended observations, and superseded,
ere long, by works of a more complete character.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Large are the treasures of oblivion. Much more is buried in silence than recorded; and
the largest volumes are but epitomes of what hath been. The account of Time began with
night, and darkness still attendeth it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Browne.</span></p></div>


<p>History which is derived from written materials must necessarily
begin only where civilisation has advanced to so ripe a state, that the
songs of the bard, and the traditions of the priest, have ceased to satisfy
the cravings of the human mind for mastery over the past and the
future. It has been too generally assumed that history is an inconceivable
thing independent of written materials. Historians have
accordingly, with a transient and incredulous glance at the fabulous
infancy of nations, been too frequently content to leave their annals
imperfect and maimed of those chapters that should record the deeply
interesting story of their origin and rise. This mode of dealing with
history is happily no longer sanctioned by the example of the ablest
of its modern investigators. They are at length learning to analyze
the myths which their predecessors rejected; and the results have
already rewarded their toil, though much still remains obscure, or
utterly unknown.</p>

<p>Gifted with an inspired pen, Moses has recorded in briefest words
the story of the world's infancy: that, therefore, is rendered independent
of myth or fable. But quitting that single illuminated spot,
how shall the investigator recover the annals of our race during the
dubious interval between the era of the dispersion of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
family and the earliest contribution of written materials? Job, we
know, was no Hebrew, but a man of Uz, in the land to which Edom
succeeded. Could we fix his era, it would be of interest; for we know
that he lived in a literate age; and his desire against his adversary
was, <i>that he had written a Book</i>! But Biblical students are disagreed
as to this epoch. A recent German critic brings it down to the
period of the Exodus, while the great majority of commentators have
heretofore placed it some 700 years nearer Creation. We must, meanwhile,
be content to receive this as one pregnant scene of primitive
social life incorporated into the Book of Books, while all the rest are
swallowed up with the old centuries to which they belonged. It has
to be intercalated as best may be, into its place in the first chapters
of human history, ere we grope our way onward or backward, seeking
amid the darkness for that historic oasis&mdash;the first establishment
of the human race on the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p>Wilkinson places the era of Menes, the founder of Egyptian
monarchy, and probably one of the earliest wanderers from the eastern
cradle of our race, some 2200 years <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Bunsen, aiming, in his
"Ægyptens Stelle in der Weltgeschichte," at fixing the exact year,
assigns that of 3643 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, or, in other words, 1295 years before the
commonly accepted era of the Deluge. Yet even this has not satisfied
all the requisites of newly discovered data. Fleury, in his "L'Egypte
Pharaonique," carries back the Menean age some 1600 years farther
into the past; and B&ouml;ckh, following out an independent series of
investigations, fixes the same era, in his "Manetho und die Hundssternperiode,"
for the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 5702. The world's early historic chronology,
it is now universally admitted, has been misinterpreted. The last date
is just 1698 years before the creation of the world, if we are still implicitly
to accept Archbishop Usher for our guide. But even this it is
possible may yet be revised, as too scanty for the events which it
must comprehend; unless, following the example of one distinguished
archæologist, Mr. S. Sharpe, we consign all Egyptian history prior
to the era of Osirtesen I. to the same order of fabulous or mythic inventions
as the crude traditions of our own chroniclers, and esteem
Menes as no more than the classic Saturnus, or the Scandinavian
Odin. It is not our province here to do more than indicate the fact,
that all early chronology is liable to correction by the contributions
of new truths, its most accredited data being at best only approximations
to the desired end. "Oblivion is not to be hired. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
part must be content to be as though they had not been: to be found
in the register of God, not in the records of men. Twenty-seven
names make up the first story before the Flood, and the recorded
names ever since contain not one living century. The number of the
dead long exceedeth all that shall live. The night of time far surpasseth
the day; and who knows when was the Equinox?"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Similar necessities and difficulties meet us when we would investigate
the beginnings of younger nations. The oldest intelligible inscription
known in Scotland is that graven in Anglo-Saxon Runes on
the Ruthwell Cross, Dumfriesshire, and dating not earlier than the
ninth century. The oldest written historic documents are probably
the charters of Duncan, engrossed about the year 1035, and still preserved
among the muniments of Durham Cathedral. Prior to these
the Romans furnish some few scanty notes concerning the barbarian
Picti. The Irish annalists contribute brief but valuable additions.
The northern sagas, it is now certain, contain a still richer store of
early historic notes, which the antiquaries of Copenhagen are busily
digesting for us into available materials. Yet, after all these are ransacked,
what shall we make of the long era which intervenes between
the dispersion of the human family and the peopling of the British
Isles? When did the first rude prow touch our shores?&mdash;who were
its daring crew? Whence did language, manners, nationality, civilisation,
and letters spring? All these are questions of the deepest
interest; but on nearly all of them history is as silent as on the
annals of Chaos. With reverential piety, or with restless inquisitiveness,
we seek to know somewhat of the rude forefathers of our island
race. Nor need we despair of unveiling somewhat of the mystery of
their remote era, though no undeciphered hieroglyphics, nor written
materials, preserve one solitary record of the <span class="smcap">Menes</span> of the British Isles.</p>

<p>Human intelligence and research have already accomplished so
much, that ignorance alone can presume to resign any past event to
utter oblivion. Between "<i>the Beginning</i>," spoken of in the first verse
of the Book called Genesis, and the creation of man, the most humble
and devout of Biblical students now acknowledge the intervention of
ages, compared to which the whole era of our race is but as the progression
of the shadow one degree on the dial of time. Our whole
written materials concerning all these ages are comprehended in the
few introductory words of the Mosaic narrative, and for well-nigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
6000 years no more was known. But all the while their history lay
in legible characters around these generations who heeded them not,
or read them wrong. At length this history is being deciphered.
The geologist has mastered the characters, and page after page of the
old interleaved annals of preadamite existence are being reduced to
our <i>enchorial text</i>&mdash;to the writing of the people. The dislocated
strata are being paged, as it were, and re-arranged in their primary
order. The palimpsests are being noted, and their double readings
transferred to their correct places in the revised history. The whole
accumulations of these ages between Chaos and man are, in fact, being
dealt with by modern science much in the same way as the bibliographer
treats some monkish or collegiate library suddenly rescued
from the dust and confusion of centuries.</p>

<p>Returning to the same book of Moses, called Genesis, we find in it
another record of things since the Beginning, thus noted in a passing
parenthesis of the sacred narrative: "And God made the stars
also." Very brief words; yet these are all our written materials
about worlds and suns so filling the azure vault, that the astronomer,
scarcely conscious of using figurative language, speaks of nebulous
spaces as <i>powdered with stars</i>. Science has added somewhat to our
knowledge of these also, without written annals. The Chaldean shepherds,
who had never travelled beyond the central plain of Asia,
where we recognise the cradle-land of the human race, began the
work of unriddling these mysterious records. Copernicus, Tycho
Brahe, and Kepler, added largely, with unassisted vision, to the accumulated
observations of astronomy. Galileo supplied a new key that
unlocked many secret stores. Huygens, Newton, Herschel, Dollond,
Lord Rosse, have each given us others wherewith many more are being
opened. Astronomy and geology have both accomplished much, and
have yet to accomplish far more ere their scattered leaves can be
bound up, or their thousand lacunæ filled in. Nevertheless, histories,
it seems, may be based on other than written materials&mdash;may, indeed,
be all the more sure and incontrovertible because their evidence is
traceable to no such doubtful records.</p>

<p>It is in curious consistency with human nature that we find the
order of its investigations in the inverse ratio of their relation to itself.
In the infancy of our race men studied the stars, bringing to the aid
of their human sympathies the fancies of the astrologer to fill the
void which Astronomy could not satisfy. The earth had grown older,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and its patriarchal age was long past, when Cosmogony and Geology
had their rise. Now at length when the studies of many generations
have furnished materials for Astronomy, and the history of the earth's
crust is being patiently unravelled by numerous independent labourers,
some students of the past have inquired if the annals of our own race
may not also be recoverable. Men with zeal no less earnest than that
which has done so much for Astronomy and Geology, have found that
this also lay around the older generations, recorded in characters no
less intelligible, and containing the history of beings no less interesting
to us than the Saurians or Mammoths, to whose inheritance we
have succeeded. Bacon has remarked, in treating of the vicissitudes
of things,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "The great winding-sheets that bury all things in oblivion,
are two&mdash;deluges and earthquakes." But the weft of our historic
winding-sheet is of a feebler texture, and its unnoted folds envelop an
ampler oblivion, which also will yield secrets worth the knowing.
Not a day passes that some fact is not stored in that strange treasury,
some of them wittingly, but far more unwittingly, as the chronicles
of man. To decipher these and to apply them as the elements of a
new historic chronometry, are the legitimate ends of Archæology.</p>

<p>Slowly and grudgingly is its true position conceded to the study of
the archæologist. The world has had its laugh at him, not always
without reason. The antiquary, indeed, in our own day, has taken
the first of the laugh himself, feeling that it was not unmerited, so
long as he was the mere gatherer of shreds from the tattered and
waste leaves of the past. Now, however, when these same shreds are
being pieced together and read anew, it is found that they well repay
the labours both of collector and decipherer. But Archæology is yet
in its infancy. Little more has been done for it than to accumulate
and classify a few isolated facts. We are indeed only learning the
meaning of the several characters in which its records are engrossed.</p>

<p>The history of one of the oldest and most faithfully studied branches
of the science, may afford an example, as well as encouraging assurance,
for the whole. In 1636 the learned Jesuit, Father Kirchner,
published his "&#338;dipus Ægyptiacus," a ponderous treatise on Egyptian
hieroglyphics, completed in six folios, containing abundance of learning,
and no lack of confident assurance, but never a word of truth in
the whole. It is a fair specimen of the labours of hieroglyphic students
down to the year 1799, when M. Bouchard, a French officer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Engineers, in digging the foundation of Fort St. Julien, on the western
bank of the Nile, between Rosetta and the sea, discovered a
mutilated block of black basalt, containing three versions of one inscription
graven in the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 196, or 1995 years prior to its discovery.
Inscribed in this late era of hieroglyphic literature, Epiphanes,
whose accession it records, had decreed it to be graven not only in the
hieroglyphic or sacred characters, but also in the enchorial or popular
Egyptian writing, and in the Greek character and language. Here
then seemed to be the long-coveted key to the mysterious records of
Egypt. Casts of it were taken, fac-similes engraved and distributed
throughout Europe; and expectation, roused to the utmost pitch of
excitement, paused for a reply. But eighteen years elapsed before
Dr. Thomas Young, one of the greatest scholars of his age, mastered
the riddle of the key, established beyond doubt the alphabetic use of
hieroglyphics, and demonstrated the phonetic value of five of its characters.
It seems, perhaps, a small result for so long a period of study,
during which the attention of many of the first scholars of Europe had
been directed to the critical investigation of the inscriptions of the
Rosetta stone, and the comparison of their diverse characters. Nevertheless
it was the insertion of the point of the wedge. All that followed
was easy in comparison with it. What has since been accomplished
by the scholars of Europe in this old field of archæological
investigation, where they dealt with written though unread materials,
is now being attempted for the whole compass of its legitimate operations
by a similar union of learning and zeal, and Archæology at length
claims its just rank among the inductive sciences.</p>

<p>The visitor to the British Museum passes through galleries containing
fossil relics of the secondary and tertiary geological periods&mdash;the
gigantic evidences of former life, the tropical fauna of the carboniferous
system, and all the organic and inorganic proofs by which we
are guided in investigating the physical changes, and classifying the
extinct beings, that pertained to the older world of which they speak.
Thence he proceeds to galleries filled with the inscribed sarcophagi
and obelisks, the votive tablets, the sculptured altars, deities, or
historic decorations of Assyria, Egypt, India, Greece, and Rome,
relics which belong no less to extinct, though newer systems and orders
of being. "The antiquities," says an eminent geologist, when instituting
a nearly similar comparison, "piece on in natural sequence to
the geology; and it seems but rational to indulge in the same sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
reasonings regarding them. They are the fossils of an extinct order
of things newer than the tertiary; of an extinct race, of an extinct
religion, of a state of society and a class of enterprises which the world
saw once, but which it will never see again; and with but little assistance
from the direct testimony of history, one has to grope one's way
along this comparatively modern formation, guided chiefly, as in the
more ancient deposits, by the clue of circumstantial evidence."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Such
are the reflections of an intelligent geologist, suggested by a similar
combination of geological and historic relics to that which offers itself
to the visitor of our great National Museum. But it is even in a
more absolute sense than the geologist dreams of that the antiquities
piece on to the geology, and show the researches of the archæologist
to follow up the closing data of the older systems without a pause.
He labours to build up that most important of all the branches of
palæontology which pertains to ethnological investigations, and
which when brought to maturity will be found not less valuable as an
element in the elucidation of the history of nations and of mankind,
than the grammatical construction and the affiliations of languages,
which the ethnologist now chiefly favours. The archæologist applies
to the accumulated facts of his own science the same process of
inductive reasoning which the geologist has already employed with
such success in investigating still earlier states of being. Both deal
with unwritten history, and aim at the recovery of annals long deemed
irretrievably erased. Nor is it merely in a parallelism of process, or
a continuity of subject, that the affinity is traceable between them.
It will be found that they meet on common ground, and dispute the
heirship of some of old Time's bequests. The detritus records archæological
as well as geological facts. The more recent alluvial strata
are the legitimate property of both; while above these lie the evidences
of still later changes on the earth's surface&mdash;the debris of successive
ages, the buried ruins, the entombed works of art, and "the
heaps of reedy clay, into which chambered cities melt in their mortality"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;the
undisputed heirlooms of the archæologist. The younger
science treats, it is true, of recent periods, when compared with the
eras of geological computation, and of a race newer than any of those
whose organic remains are classified in the systems into which the
strata of the earth's crust have been grouped. But this race which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>last of all has peopled the globe, once teeming with living beings so
strangely diverse from all that now inhabit it, is the race of man,
whose history embraces nobler records, and has claims to a deeper interest
for us than the most wonderful of all the extinct monsters that
once</p>

</div></div>

<p>Among the recent contributors to archæological science, the Danish
antiquaries have surpassed all others in the value and extent of their
researches. Occupying as they do a comparatively isolated seat of
early northern civilisation, where the relics of the primeval and
secondary archæological periods escaped to a great extent the disturbing
influences of Roman invasion, they possess many facilities for
its study. Notwithstanding this, however, the mute but eloquent
relics of antiquity which abound there, excited, until a very recent
period, even less notice than they have done among the archæologists
of Ireland and Scotland, where also aboriginal traces have been little
modified by the invading legions, whose memorials nearly superseded
all others in the southern part of the British Isle. The Scandinavian
countries, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, held the chief power among
the races of the remote north in early times. Rome scarcely interfered
with their growing strength, and left their wild mythology and
poetic traditions and myths untinctured by the artificial creed which
grew up amid the luxurious scepticism of the conquerors of the world.
When the flood-tide of the legionary invaders had given back, and left
the scenes of their brief occupation like the waste lands of a forsaken
shore, the Scandinavians were the first to step into their deserted
conquests. Fearlessly navigating seas where no Roman galley
dared to have sailed, the Scandinavian warriors conquered the coasts
of the Baltic and the German Ocean, occupied many parts of the
British Isles, and especially established permanent settlements in the
north of Scotland, and the isles on its northern and western coasts.
Their power was felt on the shores of France and Spain, and they
retaliated even on Italy the unavenged wrongs of the north. America
was visited and partially occupied by them fully three centuries before
Columbus steered his venturous course across the Atlantic. Greenland
was colonized by them, and Iceland became the central point in their
system of maritime operations. In that remote island the old northern
language still lives, dialects of which were anciently spoken among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the Scandinavian races, including the Anglo-Saxons of the south, and
the Norsemen of the Scottish mainland and the Northern Isles.</p>

<p>Enduring traces of these hardy colonists still remain to furnish
evidence of the source of much of our national character and hereditary
customs. The religion of the Angles, the Saxons, the Scottish
Norsemen, the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Scandinavians, was
similar. Christianity, which supplanted so much else, could not
root out the memorials of their wild creed, which preserve in the
names of the days of the week those of Tyr, Woden, Thur, and Frea,
favourite deities of the Scandinavian mythology. In Iceland a large
portion of the literature of this northern race still survives, in the
form of mythic songs, sagas, laws, and other historic treasures. To
this the attention of Danish and Norwegian antiquaries is now devoted
with untiring enthusiasm, and already we are possessed of some
of its fruits. These are of immense value to all the nations allied to
the common stock, and among them Scotland ranks more directly
than any other portion of the British Isles. The promised contribution
by the antiquaries of Copenhagen to the written materials of
history, of the "Antiquitates Britannicæ et Hibernicæ," cannot fail to
add a historic era to early Scottish annals, richer in suggestive interest
even than the romantic chronicles of the long lost "Vinland,"
by which, in their "Antiquitates Americanæ," they have added three
centuries to the history of the new world.</p>

<p>A mingled race now occupies Britain, diverse in name, and still
distinct in blood. The names of England and Scotland, however,
contradict the character of the races. While the natives of the South
retain the name of Angul, the father of the Scandinavian colonists,
long since nearly superseded by Germano-Teutonic races, the Celtic
Highlanders, and the Lowlanders of the North, alike take that of
the Irish Scoti, the conquerors of the older Celtæ; though there is not
wanting evidence to show, that the peculiar characteristics of the
hardy Lowland race, including those of the whole north-eastern mainland,
and the Northern Isles, are chiefly derived from the mingled
Norse and Saxon blood of a Teutonic ancestry. But older races than
the Scandinavian Vikings were colonists of the British Isles. Christianity
has failed to obliterate the traces of the creed of Woden. Still
less influential have been the modifications of Teutonic and Scandinavian
dialects in supplanting the older Celtic names which cling to
every hill, valley, and stream, though the Celtic race has, for nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
eight centuries, ceased to occupy aught but the north-western Highlands
of Wales and Scotland. The ethnologist has yet to solve the
problem as to whether there exist not among these traces of still
older tongues, pertaining to races who have left other but no less
certain memorials of their former presence. From the remotest era
to which historical tradition points, the Celtæ are found in possession
of the north-west of Europe, whither they appear to have been gradually
driven, by successive migrations of younger races from the
same eastern centre, to which we refer the origin of the whole human
family. We can trace, by unmistakable indications, the gradual
western migration of this people, until we find them hemmed in
between the younger races and the sea, on the north-west coasts of
France, and along the mountainous regions of the west in the British
Isles, where the invaders of the more fertile regions of the low countries
have not cared to follow them. Modern philologists discover a
clear affinity between the Celtic dialects and the languages known
by the general title of Indo-European, affording confirmation of that
eastern origin assigned to them, both by tradition and history, but
which is no less true of the newer races which supplanted them. The
essential differences between these remain markedly distinguishable
after centuries of peaceful intercourse, and a common interchange of
rights and privileges. The Scottish Gael, though by no means to be
now regarded as sprung from a pure Celtic stock, scarcely differs more
widely in language than in moral and intellectual characteristics from
the race that peoples the fertile Lowlands. Yet the names of the
most remarkable Lowland localities prove their possession by a Celtic
race, whom therefore we cannot doubt to have been the prior, if not
the aboriginal, occupants of the soil.</p>

<p>Of late years the direct evidence of the character of the primitive
races of Europe, furnished by their sepulchral remains, has been made
the subject of careful investigation by distinguished ethnologists, both
of Denmark and Sweden. Eschricht, Nillson, and Retzius, have all
aimed by this means to recover the traces of the colonists of the north
of Europe, and have discovered different physical types, apparently
corresponding to the successive stages of advancement in civilisation,
which the more direct archæological evidence establishes. Arguing
from these results, Professor Nillson arrives at the conclusion that the
northern relics of the Stone Period are not the memorials of the Celtæ,
but of a much older and unknown race, which in the course of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
has disappeared before the immigration of more powerful nations.
Similar ideas are now generally gaining ground among ethnologists.
"Within their own pale," Dr. Latham remarks, "the Celts were the
encroaching family of the oldest, the Romans of the next oldest, and
the Anglo-Saxons and Slavonians of the recent periods of history."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
On like grounds to those by which Professor Nillson arrives at the
conclusion that the Celtæ were preceded in the north by other races,
Danish and Swedish ethnologists concur in rejecting the idea of the
Fins having been the aboriginal race of Scandinavia. The earliest
people, whose remains are found accompanied with the primitive class
of implements, prior to the introduction of metals, appear to have
belonged to a family of different physical character from those of any
of the Arian races, and have been supposed to present features of
greater affinity to the nations of Northern Asia. Professor Nillson,
who has carefully examined the skeletons of the aboriginal Swedish
colonists, and especially noted the conformation of their crania,
states that they are readily distinguished from all the subsequent
inhabitants of Scandinavia. They present the same peculiar form of
cranium which has been recognised as existing among several ancient
peoples, such as the Iberians or Basques of the Pyrenees, the Lapps
and Samoyedes, and the Pelasgi, some traces of whom are still found
in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The last noted coincidence is of considerable interest,
both from the ancient prevalence there of cyclopean architecture,
and other traces of primitive arts of unknown antiquity, and also from
its vicinity to the Asiatic centre of aboriginal emigration. Dr. Latham
remarks, in reply to the question, "Is there reason to believe that
any definite stock or division of our species has become either wholly
extinct, or so incorporated as to be virtually beyond the recognition
and analysis of the investigator? With the vast majority of the <i>so-called</i>
<i>extinct</i> stocks, this is not the case; <i>e.g.</i>, it is not the case with
the old Gauls of Gallia, who, though no longer extant, have extant
congeners&mdash;the Welsh and Gaels. To an extinction of this kind
among the better known historic nations of Europe and Asia, the
nearest approach is to be found in the history of the Pelasgi."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It
will be of no slight interest if we can trace the congeners of this
ancient people among the extinct aborigines of the north of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Two later races are supposed to have succeeded each other in
Scandinavia prior to its colonization by the true Swea race, the first
settlement of which in Scandinavia Professor Nillson assigns to a
much more recent date than has been commonly supposed&mdash;probably
some time in the sixth century. Mr. Worsaae justly remarks, in his
"Primeval Antiquities of Denmark,"&mdash;"It is a vain error to assume
that certain races must incontestably be the most ancient, because
they are the first which are mentioned in the few and uncertain
written records which we possess."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Unfortunately extremely little
attention has been hitherto paid to the size and form of the crania
found in British tumuli. Some few examples, however, have been
preserved, and will furnish the elements of a brief inquiry into this
interesting department of Physical Archæology, in a subsequent
chapter. To this branch of evidence it is probable that much greater
importance will be attached when it has been thoroughly investigated,
since to it we may look, with considerable confidence, for a distinct
reply to the inquiry, which other departments of archæological evidence
suggest as to the existence of primitive races in Britain prior
to the Celtæ. So far as our present limited data admit of general
conclusions being drawn, we find traces of more than one race, differing
greatly in physical characteristics from any of the successive
colonists of Britain within the era of authentic history. Professor
Nillson is of opinion that the type of the old Celtic cranium is intermediate
to the true dolicho-kephalic and brachy-kephalic forms, a
conclusion in which Dr. Thurnam and others concur. Such is not the
form of cranium of either of the races of the Scottish tumuli, and in
so far, therefore, as such forms may be assumed to be permanent, we
are necessarily led to the conclusion, that in these we recover traces
of the Allophylian pioneers of the human family in Britain.</p>

<p>The infancy of all written history is necessarily involved in fable.
Long ere the scattered families have conjoined their patriarchal unions
into tribes and clans, acknowledging some common chief, and submitting
their differences to the rude legislation of the arch-priest or
civil head of the commonwealth, treacherous tradition has converted
the story of their birth into the wildest admixture of myth and
legendary fable. To unravel the complicated skein, and recover the
pure thread divested of all its extraneous acquisitions, is the impos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>sible
task of the historian. This period past&mdash;so momentous in the
influence it exercises on all the years that follow&mdash;the historian finds
himself among materials more manageable in some respects, though
not always more trustworthy. He reaches the era of chronicles,
records, and, still better, of diplomas, charters, deeds of gift, and the
like honest documents, which being written with no thought of posterity
by their compilers, are the only really trustworthy chronicles
that posterity has inherited. This historic epoch of Scotland is involved
in even more obscurity than that which clouds the dim and
fabulous morning of most nations. We have indeed the few but invaluable
allusions of Roman authors supplying important and generally
trustworthy data. But it is only a momentary glimpse of
sunshine. For the era succeeding we have little better than the
perplexing admixture of traditions, facts, and pious legends of monkish
chroniclers, furnished with a copiousness sufficiently characteristic
of the contrast between the literary legionary of imperial Rome, and
the cloistered soldier of her papal successor. Amid these dusty acres
of parchment must we glean for older dynasties and monarchical
pedigrees&mdash;not seldom tempted to abandon the weedy furrows in disgust
or despair. It is with no lack of zeal or courage, however, that
these soldiers of the Church have encountered the oblivious past into
which we still peer with no less resolute inquisitiveness. Bede,
Fordun, Wyntoun, Boece, and the other penmen of the cloisters who,
more or less accurately, chronicled contemporary history, all contributed
their quota to the thick mists of fable which obscure the
earlier annals of the country. Wyntoun, the best of our Scottish
chroniclers, following the example of other monkish historians, begins
his work as near <i>the beginning</i> as may be, with a treatise on
angels, before proceeding to "manny's fyrst creatoune!" In the
sixth chapter he gets the length of "Ye Arke of Noe, and of the
Spate," and after treating of <i>Ynde</i>, <i>Egype</i>, <i>Afryk</i>, and many other
lands with an enviable and leisurely composure, he at length reaches
the threshold of his legitimate subject, and glances, in the thirteenth
chapter of his Scottish Chronicles, at "how Bretanne and Irlande
lyis." This, however, is a mere passing notice; nor is it till after the
dedication of many more successive chapters of his first five books to
the general history of the world, that the author of the "Orygynale
Cronykil of Scotland" quits his ample theme, and devotes himself
exclusively to the professed object of his investigation, with only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
such occasional deviations as might be expected from an ecclesiastical
historian.</p>

<p>With such laborious chroniclers peering into the past, which lay
fully five centuries nearer them than it does to us, there might seem
little left for the men of this older generation to do. But unhappily
the very best of monkish chroniclers must be consulted with caution
even as contemporary historians, and scarcely at all as the recorders
of what passed any length of time prior to their own day; their information
being nearly as trustworthy in regard to Noah and his <i>spate</i>,
as to the traditions of generations immediately preceding their own.
Lord Hailes begins his annals with the accession of Malcolm Canmore,
"because the history of Scotland previous to that period is
involved in obscurity and fable." Tytler, with even less courage
than Lord Hailes, commences only at the accession of Alexander the
Third, "because it is at this period that our national annals become
particularly interesting to the general reader."</p>

<p>Till recently, the never-failing apology for all obscurities and deficiencies
in Scottish history, has been the rape of our muniments
by Edward and Cromwell. The former spoliation supplied for some
centuries an excuse for all degrees of ignorance, inconsistencies, or
palpable blunders; and the latter came most conveniently to hand
for more recent dalliers in the same pleasant field of historic rambling.
Edward and Cromwell both contributed a helping hand to
the obscurity of Scottish history, in so far as they carried off and
destroyed national records which could ill be spared. The apology,
however, has been worth far more to maundering manufacturers
of history than the lost muniments were ever likely to have proved.
Not a few of these irrecoverable national records, so long deplored, it
begins to be shrewdly suspected, never had any existence. Many more
of them, it is found, were not sought for, or they might have been
discovered to have never left their old repositories. Diligent Scottish
antiquaries, finding this hereditary wail over lost muniments a very
profitless task, have of late years betaken themselves to the study
of what remained, and have been rewarded by the recovery of chest-loads
of dusty charters and deeds of all sorts, of the twelfth, thirteenth,
and fourteenth centuries, containing mines of historic information.
The Scottish chartularies, now printed by various Clubs
of literary antiquaries, disclose to us information scarcely open to
a doubt, concerning old laws, feudal customs, servitude, tenure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
property, ecclesiastical corporate rights, the collision of lay and
clerical interests, and the final transference of monastic lands to lay
proprietors. The old apology, therefore, of muniments lost or destroyed,
will no longer serve the Scottish historian. Imperfectly as
these treasures have yet been turned to account, medieval history is
no longer obscure. Many fallacies are already exploded, and many
more must speedily follow. The legends of the old chroniclers must
be tried by the tests of documents written sometimes by the same
authors, but with no thought that history would ever question them
for the truth.</p>

<p>Yet ample as is the field thus open to the literary antiquary, these
will only partially satisfy earnest longings after a knowledge of the
past, and a clue to the old ancestral chain whereof they are but
the middle links. Ritson has already carried back the supposed
limits of authentic Caledonian history fully a thousand years before
the <i>obscurity</i> that daunted Lord Hailes. Chalmers, Gregory, Skene,
and other zealous investigators, have followed or emulated him in
the same bold inquiry. But neither do they reach the <span class="smcap">BEGINNING</span>
which we still desiderate. Much obscurity indeed vanishes. We
begin to discover that the Northern and Southern Picts, so long
the subject of mystery and fable, were no other than the aboriginal
Celtæ; while the Scots who founded the kingdom of Dalriada, in
Argyleshire, and ultimately conferred their name on the whole races
occupying ancient Caledonia, were probably, if not indeed certainly,
only another branch of the same Celtic race, who so readily amalgamated
with the older occupants of Caledonia, that the change which
is known as the "Scottish Conquest" long puzzled the historian,
from the absence of any defined traces of a progress at all commensurate
with its results. This is somewhat gained on the medieval
<i>beginning</i> which could alone be previously held tenable. But this
also begins in the wake of much progression, and glances at a period
which likewise had its old history full of no less interest to us, could
its annals be recovered.</p>

<p>In one of the few records of Sir Isaac Newton's reflections which
he has left for the help of others, the following comprehensive thought
occurs:&mdash;"It is clearly apparent that the inhabitants of this world
are of a short date, seeing that all arts, as letters, ships, printing,
needle, &amp;c., were discovered within the memory of history." The reflection
is surely a very pregnant one. The data it suggests to us as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the landmarks of time are well worth extending and turning to
account, if so be that with their aid we can arrive at some trustworthy
system of chronology, whereby to travel back towards that
date which we reckon to be the beginning of things.</p>

<p>In this inquiry the labours of the literary antiquary, however
zealously pursued, will but little avail us in reaching the desired
point. The antiquary, nevertheless, has been long familiar with the
elements of this older history, though turning them to very much
the same profitable account as, till a very recent period, he did the
hieroglyphic records graven on the granite tablets along the Nile.
The first of arts mentioned by Newton is letters; justly first in point
of dignity and universal value. Far homelier arts, however, sufficed
the primitive races of mankind. Humble were their wants, and
limited their desires; and if we are justified by the records of
creation preserved to us in the Mosaic narrative, in assuming that
man, beginning with the woven garment of fig-leaves and the coat of
skins, has slowly progressed through successive stages to the knowledge
of nobler arts, and the higher wants of an intelligent being,
then we have only to establish evidence of the most primitive arts,
pertaining to the primeval race, in order to be assured that we have
reached the true beginning at which we aim. In the general investigation,
indeed, allowance must be made for the speedy loss of antediluvian
metallurgic arts which would follow almost of necessity on
the exodus of the primitive nomades from their Eastern birthland,
though preserved perhaps by the founders of the first Asiatic kingdoms,
and probably practised by the earliest colonists of the Nile
valley. Such at least we shall find to have been the case with the
primeval colonists of Britain.</p>

<p>This point it is at which the modern archæologist now directs his
inquiries, not altogether without the anticipation that these same
primitive arts, the product of the beginning of things, may also prove
to contain a decipherable alphabet, which may be resolved into definite
phonetics, and furnish the key to many inscriptions no less
curious and valuable than the parchments of medieval charter-chests,
or even the tablet of Abydos and the Rosetta Stone.</p>

<p>It is long since the evidences of a primitive state of society, still
abounding in the midst of modern civilisation, attracted the attention
of the antiquary. It was indeed almost a necessary consequence of
the accumulation of large collections of antiquities. The private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
hoards of "nick nackets,"&mdash;including in general a miscellaneous assortment
of relics of all ages, only sufficient to produce a confused
notion of useless or obsolete arts, without creating a definite idea of
any single era of the past,&mdash;may be aptly compared to the <i>disjecta</i>
<i>membra</i> of some beautifully-proportioned and decorated vase. Hoarded
apart, the pieces are nearly without value, and to new possessors become
even meaningless. But should the whole, by some fortunate
chance, be re-assembled in a single collection, it becomes possible for
a skilful manipulator to piece the fragments together, and replace
them with an elegant and valuable work of art. Thus it has
proved with more than one archæological museum. In 1780 the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was established, and its collection
of national antiquities begun. A brief but most suggestive paper,
read at one of its meetings in 1782, and published in the first
volume of its Transactions, shews the speedy results of such valuable
reconstructions, by means of an intelligent comparison of the primitive
relics of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But the resources of private zeal proved
inadequate to the effective pursuit of these researches into Scottish
Archæology, and the national funds found other, though not always
more valuable objects for their expenditure. The hint was lost, but
the accumulation of materials for future students was happily not
altogether abandoned.</p>

<p>"About forty years ago," says J. J. A. Worsaae, the eminent
Danish antiquary, writing in 1846, "the general character of scientific
pursuits was in our country (Denmark) much the same as in
most other parts of Europe. Great pains were spent in collecting all
sorts of objects illustrating the changes of the globe upon which we
live, and the distribution and habits of animals and plants&mdash;in short,
all the departments of Natural History; whilst, strange to say, people
for the most part neglected <i>traces of men</i>, the remains not only of their
own ancestors, but also of all the different races who have been spread
over the world. The antiquities, with the exception of those of Roman
and Greek origin, were regarded as mere curiosities, without any scientific
value."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Notwithstanding all the zeal of British archæologists
of late years, so much of this spirit still remains among us, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>would be easier, perhaps, even now, to secure the purchase by the
Trustees of the British Museum, of a Roman statue or an Egyptian
tablet, than of valuable relics of British antiquity.</p>

<p>One man has within the last thirty years accomplished, not for
Denmark only, but for Europe, what the whole united labours of
earlier archæologists failed to do. About the year 1815, the present
Danish Councillor of State, C. J. Thomsen, the son of a merchant of
Copenhagen, was appointed Secretary of a Royal Commission for the
preservation and collection of national antiquities. It had then been
in existence some seven or eight years, and the whole result of its
labours was a few miscellaneous articles, unclassified and uncared
for, lying in a small room of the University Library. His enthusiasm
in the study of the antiquities of his country surmounted all obstacles.
He had to contend alike with the theories of the scholar and the prejudices
of the unlearned. But he had succeeded to a position of the
utmost value to a man of energy and enthusiasm. From the first he
had grants (though exceedingly small ones) of public money at his
disposal. He soon enlisted the more important element of public
sympathy, and nationality of feeling, in his pursuits. His little room
became too small for accumulating purchases and donations. A suite
of apartments was yielded, at his intercession, in the Royal Palace
of Christiansborg; and as the varied collection increased in his hands,
he found himself possessed at once of the space and the elements for
systematic classification.</p>

<p>The Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities of Copenhagen now
numbers between three and four thousand specimens of stone weapons
and implements, some hundreds of bronze swords, celts, spear-heads,
armillæ, torcs, &amp;c., and a collection of native gold and silver relics
unequalled in all the museums of Europe. To it we owe the valuable
suggestion of the system of classification now universally adopted
in the nomenclature of archæological science&mdash;the <i>Stone</i>, <i>Bronze</i>, and
<i>Iron</i> periods, which, simple as it may appear, was first suggested by
Mr. Thomsen, and is justly esteemed the foundation of Archæology as
a science. By means of it the whole materials of antiquarian study
at once arrange themselves according to an intelligible chronology of
universal acceptance, and adapted in an especial degree to Northern
antiquities. This, therefore, is the system on which the following
data are arranged, subject only to such modifications as seem naturally
to arise from national or local peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter on the question, of curious interest
and value, as to whether the primeval state of man was essentially
one of barbarism, from whence he progressed by slow degrees to
social union, arts, civilisation, and political organisation into communities
and nations. The investigations of chronologists the further
they are pursued, seem only the more certainly to confer on primitive
civilisation a more remote antiquity. At the same time, they
confirm the idea, that the long accepted chronology of Archbishop
Usher, still attached to our English Bibles, cheats the world, at the
lowest computation, of fully 1400 years of its existence&mdash;a trifle perhaps
in the age of worlds, but no unimportant element in the history
of human civilisation, when we remember that between the era of the
Mosaic deluge and the accession of the Egyptian Menes, we must account
for the peopling of Egypt, the establishment of its social and political
constitution, and the founding of a civilisation, the monuments
of which are still among the most wonderful that human intellect and
labour have produced. Not the least important branch of this inquiry
relates to the primeval inhabitants of our own quarter of the
globe; of whom as yet we know only with any degree of certainty of
the Celtæ, occupying a transitional place in the history of the human
family&mdash;at once the earliest known intruders and the latest nomades
of Europe. It seems probable, from all the traces we can recover of
the original condition of this race, that it was more their deficiency
than their excess in the energy which we expect to find in the
colonists of new regions, that drove them onward in their north-western
pilgrimage, until their course was arrested by the Atlantic
barriers. They seem to have fled ever forward, like night before the
dawn, carrying with them knowledge sufficient to cope with the
savage occupants of the wilds they invaded, yet bearing into these
few arts but such as still pertain to the primitive races of mankind.
In older literary notices of this people, whose language, manners,
and arts are still traceable in our own land, we have only a secondary
interest, believing that some records of them are recoverable, noted
for us long before they had excited foreign interest. But, still more,
we doubt not that similar records also preserve the history of older
British tribes, in comparison with which the ancient Celtæ must be
regarded as of recent origin. "The antiquities of the earlier periods,"
says a distinguished English antiquary, "including all remains which
bear no evident stamp of Roman origin or influence, claim our most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
careful investigation. Exceedingly limited in variety of types, these
vestiges of the ancient inhabitants of Great Britain are not more interesting
to the antiquarian collector on account of their rarity,
than valuable to the historian. They supply the only positive evidence
in those obscure ages, regarding customs, warfare, foreign invasions,
or the influence of commerce, and the advance of civilisation
amongst the earliest races by which these islands were peopled."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Perhaps when we have bestowed on these primitive remains the degree
of careful investigation which they merit, we shall find the
variety of types less limited than is now conceived to be the case.
The archæologists of Denmark justly value the absence of all relics
of Roman art and civilisation, from the confidence it has given
to their researches into the true eras to which their own primeval
antiquities belong. Such gratulations, however, can only be of temporary
avail. The influence of Roman arts and arms furnishes an
element in the civilisation of modern Europe too important not to be
worthy of the most careful study. When the distinctive characteristics
of Roman and primitive art have been so satisfactorily established
as to admit of their separate classification without risk of
error or confusion, the British collections, with their ample store of
Anglo-Roman relics, will furnish a far more comprehensive demonstration
of national history than those northern galleries, which must
remain destitute of any native examples of an influence no less
abundantly visible in their literature and arts, than in that of nations
which received it directly from the source. In this respect
the Scottish antiquary is peculiarly fortunate in the field of observation
he occupies. While he possesses the legionary inscriptions, the
sepulchral tablets, the sculptures, pottery, and other native products
of Roman colonists or invaders, he has also an extensive and strictly
defined field for the study of primitive antiquities, almost as perfectly
free from the disturbing elements of foreign art as the most secluded
regions of ancient Scandinavia.</p>

the above remarks, to reflect on the present
official staff of the British Museum, including
as it does men no less distinguished for
their learning than for their intelligent zeal
for archæological investigation. One evil
attendant on the present defective system
of management of the Museum by a body of
Trustees, composed, for the most part, of
irresponsible <i>ex officio</i> members, is, that the
Keepers are converted into mere custodiers,
responsible for the safety of the collection,
but altogether destitute of the powers of an
efficient curatorship, such as in the hands
of Councillor C. J. Thomsen of Copenhagen
led to the development of the entire system
which has given to Archæology the character
of a science. Wherever the fault lies, however,
it is indisputable that the departments
of ethnography and antiquities, in the British
Museum, are arranged almost without
an attempt at systematic classification: one
consequence of which is, that in nearly
every town of any importance throughout
the kingdom we see local museums established,
containing a confused jumble of antiquities,
natural history, and foreign curiosities,
but without any single characteristic
of a scientific collection. The present popular
idea of a museum, in this country, differs,
indeed, in no degree, from the estimate
of an exhibition of giants and dwarfs, or
any other vulgar show; nor is this grave
error likely to be discarded till the great
model museum in London sets the example
of a systematic arrangement, devised on
some other principle than that of merely
pleasing the eye.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE PRIMEVAL TRANSITION.</h3>


<p>The closing epoch of geology, which embraces the diluvial formations,
is that in which archæology has its beginning. In a zoological
point of view, it includes man and the existing races of animals, as
well as the extinct races which appear to have been contemporaneous
with indigenous species. Archæology also lays claim to the still more
recent alluvium, with all its included relics pertaining to the historic
period. Within the legitimate scope of this department of investigation
are comprehended the entire evidence of changes on the geographical
features of the country, on its coasts and harbours, its estuaries,
rivers, and plains: all properly coming within the limits of Archæology,
though too extensive to be embraced in the present review of its
elements. This much, however, we learn from an examination of the
detritus and its included fossils, that at the period immediately preceding
the occupation of the British Islands by their first colonists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the country must have been almost entirely covered with forests, and
overrun by numerous races of animals long since extinct. Much has
been done in recent years to complete the history of British fossil
mammalia; and though less attention has been paid to the question
in which we are here most deeply interested, as to what portion of
them are to be considered as having been contemporaneous with man,
yet on this also some interesting light has been thrown. The most extensive
discoveries of mammalian remains and recent shells generally
occur along the valleys by which the present drainage of the country
takes place, and hence we infer that little change has taken place in its
physical conformation since their deposition. These, however, include
the mammoth, elephant, rhinoceros, cave tiger, with other extinct
species, and are referrible to the earlier portion of an epoch, with the
close of which we have alone to deal. They belong to that period in
which our planet was passing through its very latest stage of preparation
prior to its occupation by man; a period on which the geologist,
who deals with phenomena of the most gigantic character, and with
epochs of vast duration, is apt to dwell with diminished interest, but
which excites in the thoughtful mind a keener sympathy than all
that preceded it. The general geographical disposition of the globe
was then nearly as it still remains. Our own island was, during a
great portion of it, insulated, as it is now. Yet it is of this familiar
locality that the palæontologist remarks:&mdash;"In this island, anterior
to the deposition of the drift, there was associated with the great extinct
tiger, bear, and hyæna of the caves, in the destructive task of
controlling the numbers of the richly developed order of the herbivorous
mammalia, a feline animal, (the <i>Machairodus Latidens</i>,) as
large as the tiger, and, to judge by its instruments of destruction, of
greater ferocity."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was within the epoch to which these strange
mammals belong, and while some of them, and many other contemporaneous
forms of being, still animated the scene, that man was introduced
upon this stage of existence, and received dominion over
every living thing.</p>

<p>It has been supposed by more than one intelligent naturalist, that
the gigantic fossil elk (<i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i>) co-existed with the
human race. Dr. Hart has produced what he conceived to be conclusive
evidence on this subject, derived from the appearance of a
rib, pierced with an oval opening near its lower edge, "with the mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>gin
depressed on the outer and raised on the inner surface, round
which there is an irregular effusion of callus; in fact, such an effect
as would be produced by the head of an arrow remaining in a wound
after the shaft was broken off." This conclusion Professor Owen has
disputed, apparently on satisfactory grounds.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> By a similar line of
argument, however, to which he has yielded his assent,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> it has been
shewn that the north of Europe was occupied by the human race at
a time when the <i>Bos primigenius</i>, the <i>Bison priscus</i>, and the <i>Ursus</i>
<i>spelæus</i>, existed.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Of the <i>Ursus spelæus</i>, or great cave bear, a skeleton
is preserved in the museum of Lund, found in a peat-bog in Scania,
under a gravel or stone deposit, and alongside of primitive implements
of the chase. Though no such direct evidence has yet been observed
here, similar conclusions have been arrived at. Mr. Owen, after referring
the period of existence of the great cave bear to earlier geological
epochs, adds, as the conclusion from present evidence, "that the
genus surviving, or under a new specific form reappearing, after the
epoch of the deposition and dispersion of those enormous, unstratified,
superficial accumulations of marine and fresh-water shingle and gravel,
called drift and diluvium, has been continued during the formation
of vast fens and turbaries upon the present surface of the island, and
until the multiplication and advancement of the human race introduced
a new cause of extermination, under the powerful influence of
which the Bear was finally swept away from the indigenous fauna of
Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> To these native mammals may be added the horse,
the roebuck, the red deer, the wild boar, the brown bear, the wolf, and
the beaver, all of which have undoubtedly existed as wild animals in
this country, and been gradually domesticated or extirpated by man.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The most interesting of all the species for our present inquiry are
those adapted for domestication, among which the <i>Bovidæ</i> occupy a
prominent place. Of these, the great fossil ox (<i>Bos primigenius</i>) is very
frequently found in Scotland. Dr. Fleming describes a skull of one
in his possession measuring 27&frac12; inches in length,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and a still larger
one from Roxburghshire, now in the Scottish Antiquarian Museum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>measures 28 inches in length. No evidence leads us to conclude that
any attempt was made by the native Britons to domesticate either of
the two kinds of gigantic oxen, the bison or great urus, which the
Romans discovered on first penetrating into the north of Europe. But
besides these there was also a smaller primitive wild species, the <i>Bos</i>
<i>Longifrons</i>, of the domestication of which in Britain we have abundant
proof, at least at the period of the Roman invasion. Soon after this
it appears to have become extinct, so that we are rather led to assume
that it may have been the domesticated ox of the native population
prior to the intrusion of the Romans. Mr. Woods refers to the discovery
of the skull and horns of the great urus in a tumulus on the
Wiltshire Downs, along with bones of deer and boars, and fragments
of native pottery, in proof of the existence in this country originally
of a "very large race of <i>taurine</i> oxen, although most probably entirely
destroyed by the aboriginal inhabitants before the invasion of Britain
by Cæsar." Professor Owen has discussed the probable influence of
Roman occupation on the wild herds and the breeds of domesticated
oxen, with much sagacity, though somewhat too much influenced by
the views so generally entertained of the barbarian state of the native
Britons prior to the intrusion of Roman colonists.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Scarcely less
interesting is the evidence which British fossil mammalia furnish of
the existence of the horse among the native wild animals of the
country, since we find proof, both in the early tumuli and the subterranean
dwellings, not only of its domestication, but also of its being
used for food.</p>

<p>This very slight glance at the most prominent indications of the
primeval state of the country, will suffice to convey some idea of the
circumstances under which the aboriginal colonists entered on the
possession of the British Isles. Other portions of the same line of
argument, derived from the fossil mammalia, and the circumstances
under which they are discovered, will come under review in the course
of our inquiries. The fossil Cetacea, especially, furnish most interesting
and conclusive evidence of the very remote period at which the
presence of a human population is discoverable in Scotland, while the
beaver, (<i>Castor Europæus</i>,) which is frequently found in a fossil state,
is also proved to have existed as a living species, both in Scotland
and Wales, down to the twelfth century, and is even referred to so
late as the fifteenth century. To the abundance of wild animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
which continued to occupy the moors and forests of Scotland, long
after the primitive states of society had entirely passed away, we
shall also have occasion hereafter to refer. The same causes which
exterminated the huge urus, the cave bear, and others of the largest
and most intractable of the wild denizens of the British forests,
ultimately led to the extinction of the greater number of those which
either supplied objects of the chase, or were inimical to the social
progress of man. Thus we observe, in the economy of nature, that
one species after another disappears, to make way for newer occupants,
until at length the last of those huge preadamite races of being give
place, before the gradual advancement of man to assume possession of
terrestrial dominion. Yet on this point also those questions in historic
chronology, which tend to determine more precisely the lapse of centuries
intervening between the Adamic creation and the earliest
era of authentic history, exercise an important influence. Geology
leaves no room for questioning the fact, that man did not enter upon
this earth after some tremendous cosmical revolution, which made
way for an entirely new race of beings, but that he was introduced
as the lord of an inheritance already in possession of many inferior
orders of creation. Contemporary with the most remarkable cave
fossils are found the remains of many historic, or still existing species,
and the precise line has yet to be drawn which shall determine how
many of these were extinct, at the period when the Creator, at length
satisfied with his inferior works, said, "Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness." The remains, both of the large cave
hyæna, (<i>Hyæna spelæa</i>,) and of the great cave tiger, (<i>Felis spelæa</i>,)
occur not only in ossiferous caverns, but have also been found in
superficial unstratified deposits. Considerable portions of the skeleton
of the latter were discovered in 1829, along with remains of the
mammoth, rhinoceros, ox, stag, and horse, in a marl-pit near North
Cliff, Yorkshire. Under precisely similar geological circumstances
the <i>Bos primigenius</i> has very frequently been brought to light in
Scotland. It is of this animal that Sir R. I. Murchison remarks,
in a letter to Professor Owen, descriptive of an example already referred
to, found in a bog in Scania: "This urus is most remarkable
in exhibiting a wound of the apophysis of the second dorsal
vertebra, apparently inflicted by a javelin of one of the aborigines,
the hole left by which was exactly fitted by Nillson with one of the
ancient stone javelins.... This instrument fractured the bone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
penetrated to the apophysis of the third dorsal vertebra, which is also
injured. The fractured portions are so well cemented, that Nillson
thinks the animal probably lived two or three years after. The wound
must have been inflicted over the horns, and the javelin must have
been hurled with prodigious force." Of the existence, therefore, of the
<i>Bos primigenius</i> within the historic epoch, we can entertain no doubt,
and it is accordingly requisite to give full weight to the influence
which its presence must have exercised on the general condition of
our island. Professor Owen remarks, after showing the erroneous
nature of the usually received opinion, that the lion, the tiger, and
the jaguar, are peculiarly adapted to a tropical climate:&mdash;"A more
influential, and, indeed, the chief cause or condition of the prevalence
of the larger feline animals, in any given locality, is the
abundance of the vegetable feeding animals in a state of nature, with
the accompanying thickets or deserts unfrequented by man. The
Indian tiger follows the herds of antelope and deer, in the lofty
Himalayan chain, to the verge of perpetual snow. The same species
also passes that great mountain barrier, and extends its ravages with
the leopard, the panther, and the cheetah, into Bocharia, to the Altaic
chain, and into Siberia, as far as the fiftieth degree of latitude; preying
principally, according to Pallas, on the wild horses and asses."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
No change, therefore, of climate, nor any remarkable geological
revolution is needful to account for the disappearance of the huge
British carnivora, the remains of which abound in the ossiferous caves.
They pertain to the closing transition-period of the preadamite
earth, and, as in other transition-periods which we shall have to consider,
some traces of them survived among the inheritors of the new
era. It is therefore a legitimate source of interest to the archæologist,
to observe the mingling of extinct and familiar species among
the fossil mammals found in the superficial deposits, wherein so much
of the evidence of his own science must be sought. It discovers to
him the precise link by which his pursuits take hold of the great
chain of truth, and in a new sense shews man, not as an isolated
creation, but as the last and best of an order of animated beings,
whose line sweeps back into the far removed shadow of an unmeasured
past. "Phenomena like these," says Professor Sedgwick, when referring
to the discoveries at the North Cliff, Yorkshire, in 1829, "have
a tenfold interest, binding the present order of things to that of older
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>periods, in which the existing forms of animated nature seem one
after another to disappear."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Thus much is apparent from the most superficial glance at the
geological evidence of the primeval state of Britain within the historic
era, that though corresponding in its great geographical outlines to
its present condition, it differed, in nearly every other respect, as
widely as it is possible for us to conceive of a country capable of
human occupation. A continuous range of enormous forests covered
nearly the whole face of the country. Vast herds of wild cattle, of
gigantic proportions and fierce aspect, roamed through the chase,
while its thickets and caves were occupied by carnivora, preying
on the herbivorous animals, and little likely to hold in dread the
armed savage who intruded on their lair. The whole of these have
existed since the formation of the peat began, and therefore furnish
some evidence of the very remote antiquity to which we must refer
the origin of some of the wastes that supply, as will be seen in subsequent
chapters, an important element in the elucidation of primitive
chronology. Upon this singular arena Archæology informs us that
the primeval Briton entered, unprovided with any of those appliances
with which the arts of civilisation arm man against such obstacles.
Intellectually, he appears to have been in nearly the lowest stage to
which an intelligent being can sink; morally, he was the slave of a
superstition, the grovelling character of which will be traced in reviewing
his sepulchral rites; physically, he differed little in stature
from the modern inheritors of the same soil, but his cerebral development
was poor, his head small in proportion to his body, his hands,
and probably his feet, also small; while the weapons with which he
provided himself for the chase, and the few implements that ministered
to his limited necessities, indicate only the crude development
of that inventive ingenuity which first distinguishes the reason of
man from the instincts of the brutes. The evidence from which such
conclusions are deduced, forms the subject of the following chapters.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

ABORIGINAL TRACES.</h3>


<p>Though we are assured, and cannot doubt, that man was created an
intelligent being, capable of enjoying the high faculties with which
he alone of all the denizens of earth was endowed, we have no reason
to assume that he had any conception of the practical arts by which
we are enabled to satisfy wants of which he was equally unconscious.
We know on the same authority that there existed a period in the
history of our race, ere Zillah, the wife of Lamech, had borne to him
Tubal-cain, "the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron," when
men tilled the ground, pursued the chase, made garments of its
spoils, and constructed tents to dwell in, without any knowledge of
the working in metals, on which the simplest of all our known arts
depend. Through such a stage of primitive arts most, perhaps all,
nations have passed. We detect evidences of it among the Egyptians,
old as the date of their civilisation appears, in the stone knives of the
embalmers, still frequently found in the catacombs. By such only
could the incision be made in the side of the dead, through which to
extract the intestines; and when they had been cleansed and replaced,
the eye of Osiris, the judge of the dead, was placed as a mysterious
seal over the sacred incision. The feeling in which such a custom
originated, arising from the veneration which appears to be universally
attached to whatever is ancient, is easily understood. While the
knife of bronze or iron was freely employed for all ordinary purposes,
the primitive stone implement was retained unchanged for the sacred
incision in the dead. So also, probably from a like idea directly borrowed
from the Egyptians, the stone or flint knife appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
been used by the early Hebrews in circumcision. Zipporah, Moses'
wife, took a sharp stone, or stone knife, and cut off the foreskin of her
son. The like was done when Joshua renewed the same rite at Gilgal
in the east border of Jericho; while a still more remarkable community
of feeling with the veneration of the ancient Egyptians for the otherwise
obsolete implement of stone, is discernible in its retention by the
priests of Montezuma as the instrument of human sacrifice.</p>

<p>The substitution of flint, stone, horn, and wood, in the absence of
metal weapons and implements, must be abundantly familiar to all,
in the customs of society when met with in a rude and primitive
condition. The Fins and Esquimaux, the African bushmen, and the
natives of such of the Polynesian Islands as are rarely visited by
Europeans, still construct knives and arrow-heads of flint or fish-bone,
and supply themselves with wooden clubs and stone adzes and hammers,
with little consciousness of imperfection or deficiency in such
appliances. Examples of such a state of arts and human skill might
be multiplied from the most dissimilar sources. It seems, as has
been already remarked, to be a stage through which all nations have
passed, not without each developing a sufficient individuality to render
their arts well worthy of investigation by their descendants. To
this primitive era of history we refer under the name of <span class="smcap">The Stone</span>
<span class="smcap">Period</span>.</p>

<p>In this state were the Scottish, and indeed the whole British aborigines,
at an era much more remote than chronologists have been
willing to assign for the occupation of the island by a human population,
and for a period the duration of which we are also able in some
degree to test.</p>

<p>There is one certain point in this inquiry into primitive arts which
the British antiquary possesses over all others, and from whence he
can start without fear of error, though I am not aware that its importance
in this view has heretofore been noted. From our insular
position it is unquestionable that the first colonist of the British
Isles must have been able to construct some kind of boat, and have
possessed sufficient knowledge of navigation to steer his course through
the open sea. Contrasting the aboriginal arts to which we have referred
with the appliances of later navigators, it seems only reasonable
to conclude that the bark of the primeval Columbus, who led the way
from the continent of Europe to the untrodden wilds of Britain, differed
no less from the caravel of the bold Genoese, than that did from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the British ship that now follows in its course. Can we recover the history
of such primitive caravel? It seems not improbable that we may.
Time has dealt kindly with the frail fleets of the aboriginal Britons,
and kept in store some curious records of them, not doubting but
these would at length be inquired for.</p>

<p>It is by no means to be presumed as certain that the early navigators
chose the Straits of Dover as the readiest passage to the new world
they were to people. Both Welsh and Danish traditions point to
a migration from Jutland. Whencesoever the first emigrants came,
Providence alone could pilot their frail barks. Successive migrations,
the chances of shipwreck, or the like independent causes, may have
landed the fathers of the British race on widely different parts of our
island coast. It is a well established fact, that at later periods many
distinct and rival centres of population were thus established throughout
the British Isle.</p>

<p>Lochar Moss, a well-known tract in Dumfriesshire, occupies an
area of fully twelve miles in length, by between two and three miles
in breadth, extending to the Solway Frith. Its history is summed
up in an old popular rhyme, still repeated in the surrounding districts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First a wood, and next a sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now a moss, and ever will be!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lying as it does on the southern outskirts of the Scottish kingdom,
the track of many successive generations has lain along its margin or
across its treacherous surface, beneath which their records have been
from time to time engulfed, to be restored in after ages to the light
of day. To these we shall have occasion again to refer; but among
them our chief attention is meanwhile attracted by its ancient canoes,
repeatedly found along with huge trunks of trees, hazel-nuts, acorns,
and other traces of the forest, and also, according to the old statist
of Torthorwald parish, "anchors, cables, and oars," the no less obvious
heirlooms of the sea. During the last century the peats cut from this
moss formed almost the sole supply of fuel to the inhabitants of Dumfries
and its neighbourhood, nor have they yet ceased to avail themselves
of its ready stores.</p>

<p>In 1782 Pennant examined one of these rude barks formed from
the trunk of an oak, which he thus describes: "Near a place called
Kilblain, I met with one of the ancient canoes of the primeval inhabitants
of the country, when it was probably in the same state of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as Virginia when first discovered by Captain Philip Amidas. The
length of this little vessel was eight feet eight inches, of the cavity six
feet seven inches, the breadth two feet, depth eleven inches, and at
one end were the remains of three pegs for the paddle. The hollow was
made with fire in the very manner that the Indians of America formed
their canoes. Another was found in 1736, with its paddle, in the same
morass. The last was seven feet long, and dilated to a considerable
breadth at one end, so that in early ages necessity dictated the same
inventions to the most remote regions."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In 1791 the minister of
the parish describes another found by a farmer while digging for peats,
at a depth of between four and five feet from the surface, and four
miles from the highest reach of the tide, resting apparently on the
alluvial soil which is there found beneath the moss. Near to the same
spot a vessel of mixed metal, and apparently of great antiquity, was
recovered, and numerous relics of various kinds, including what are
described as anchors, oars, and other naval implements, have been
found even at a distance of twelve miles from the present flood-mark&mdash;attesting
at once the former populousness of the district, and the very
remote period to which these evidences of its occupation belong.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
At a depth of seven or eight feet in the Moss of Barnkirk, in the
immediate neighbourhood of Newton-Stewart, Wigtonshire, another
canoe of the same character as those already described, was dug up
in 1814, and has been preserved, owing to its being converted by the
farmer into the lintel of one of his cart-sheds. Mr. Joseph Train
mentions having seen "a ball of fat or bannock of tallow, weighing
twenty-seven pounds,"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> found in the moss immediately above the
canoe; and which no doubt was a mass of adipocere, indicating the
spot where some large animal had perished in the moss: possibly
sinking along with the rude British vessel that lay below. On the
draining of Carlinwark Loch, Kirkcudbright, in 1765, a stone dam,
an ancient causeway constructed on piles of oak, the vestiges of an
iron forge, and other remarkable evidences of human industry and
skill, were brought to light, including various canoes, described, like
those of Lochar Moss and others found in Merton Mere, as apparently
hollowed by fire.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Loch of Doon in Ayrshire, has at different periods furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>similar relics of ancient naval art. The fall of its waters in 1832,
owing to an unusually protracted drought, permitted the recovery of
two of these in a perfect state, one of them measuring about twenty-three
feet in length, formed of a single oak tree, with the insertion of
an upright plank into a broad groove for the stern. Numerous other
relics of canoes were found to be imbedded in the same place; and the
head of an ancient battle axe, a rude oak club, with other remains,
gave further clue to the character of their builders.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire, has furnished similar canoes, accompanied
by other relics of various eras&mdash;a brass ladle or patera, with
an elegant handle terminating with a ram's head, probably Roman;
and a very fine brass cannon, marked J. R. S. (5?) an antiquity of
comparatively modern date.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Five fathoms deep in the Carse of Falkirk, a complete boat was
discovered, not far from the town, and therefore remote from any
navigable water.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Sir John Clerk, well known as an enthusiastic
Scottish antiquary of last century, describes with great minuteness
another vessel found in the same locality, more remarkable from its
size and construction than any of those yet described, and which he
pronounces, from the series of superincumbent strata, to have been
<i>an antediluvian boat</i>! In the month of May 1726 a sudden rise of the
river Carron undermined a portion of its banks, and exposed to view
the side of this ancient boat lying imbedded in the alluvial soil, at a
depth of fifteen feet from the surface, and covered by successive strata
of clay, shells, moss, sand, and gravel. The proprietor immediately
ordered it to be dug out. It proved to be a canoe of primitive form,
but of larger dimensions than any other discovered to the north of the
Tweed. It measured thirty-six feet long by four feet in extreme
breadth, and is described in a contemporary newspaper as finely
polished and perfectly smooth both inside and outside, formed from a
single oak tree, with the usual pointed stem and square stern.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Mingling with such indisputable traces of human art, are deposited
the memorials of many successive changes. Among older relics of
the same Carse, in the Edinburgh Museum, are the remains of a fossil
elephant found in excavating the Union Canal in 1821, at a depth of
some twenty feet in the alluvial soil, with the ivory in such perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>preservation that it was purchased and cut up by a turner, and only
rescued in fragments from his lathe.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>But at higher levels in the valley of the Forth, and further from
the sea, still more remarkable evidences of the primitive occupants of
the country have been found. The ingenious operations by which the
Blair Drummond moss has been converted into fertile fields have rendered
it famous in the annals of modern engineering and agriculture.
In the Carse lands, of which it forms a part, there was discovered in
the year 1819, at a distance of a mile from the river, and in an alluvial
soil, covered with a thin moss, the surface of which stood some
twenty-five feet above the full tide of the Forth, the skeleton of a
whale, with a perforated lance or harpoon of deer's horn beside it.
A few years later another whale was found, and in 1824 a third was
disclosed on the Blair Drummond estate seven miles further inland,
and overlaid with a thick bed of moss. Beside it also lay the rude
harpoon of the hardy Caledonian whaler; in this instance retaining,
owing to the preservative nature of the moss, some remains of the
wooden handle by which the pointed lance of deer's horn was wielded.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
This primitive relic is now deposited, along with the fossil remains
of the whale, whose death-wound it may have given, in the Natural
History Museum of the Edinburgh University. Professor Owen remarks,
in referring to this class of fossils,&mdash;"Although these depositories
belong to very recent periods in geology, the situations of the
cetaceous fossils generally indicate a gain of dry land from the sea.
Thus the skeleton of a balænoptera, seventy-two feet in length, found
imbedded in clay on the banks of the Forth, was more than twenty
feet above the reach of the highest tide. Several bones of a whale
discovered at Dunmore rock, Stirlingshire, in brick-earth, were nearly
forty feet above the present level of the sea.... I might add other
instances of the discovery of cetaceous remains in positions to
which, in the present condition of the dry land of England, the sea
cannot reach; yet the soil in which these remains are imbedded is
alluvial or amongst the most recent formation. In most cases the
situation indicates the former existence there of an estuary that has
been filled up by deposits of the present sea, or the bottom of which
has been upheaved."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Other relics besides those of the whale and the
implement of its hardy assailant, were recovered in the course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>removing the Blair Drummond moss. In the collection of the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland, a rude querne or hand-mill for pounding
grain is preserved, fashioned from the section of an oak tree, which
was found in 1831, at a depth of nearly five feet, in this moss. A
wooden wheel of ingenious construction is also in the collection, which
was dug up at more than double the depth of the querne, in the same
locality, accompanied with several well-formed arrow-heads of flint.
It measured when complete about two feet in diameter; but it is
greatly decayed, having shrunk and cracked since its removal from
the moss.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Other relics, though belonging apparently to a later period, may
be noticed along with these. In the progress of improvements on
the Kincardine moss, the remains of a singular roadway were discovered,
after the peat moss had been removed to a depth of eight feet.
Seventy yards of the ancient viaduct were exposed to view, formed
of trees about twelve inches in diameter, having other trees of half
this thickness crossing them, and brushwood covering the whole.
This road crossed the moss of Kincardine northward, from a narrow
part of the Forth, towards a well-known line of Roman road which
has been traced from a ford on the river Teith to Camelon, on the
Antonine wall. This singular structure, though so unlike anything
usually found on the line of the legionary iters, has been assigned,
with great probability, to Roman workmanship, as it appears to be
designed to keep up a communication with the well-known station at
Ardoch. But if so, we have here evidence of the fact that in the
second century of our era the Kincardine moss was an unstable and
boggy waste, which the Roman engineer could only pass by abandoning
his favourite and durable causeway, for such a road as modern
ingenuity has revived in the backwood swamps of America.</p>

<p>Such are some of the ancient chronicles of Scotland garnered for
us in the eastern valley of the Forth. The banks of the Clyde have
been scarcely less liberal in their disclosures. In 1780, the first recorded
discovery of one of the primitive canoes of the Clyde was
made by workmen engaged in digging the foundation of Old St.
Enoch's Church. It was found at a depth of twenty-five feet from
the surface, and within it there lay a no less interesting and eloquent
memorial of the simple arts of the remote era when the navies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Clyde were hewn out of the oaks of the Caledonian forests. This is
a beautifully-finished stone celt, represented in the woodcut&mdash;doubtless
one of the simple implements of its owner, if not, indeed, one of
the tools with which such vessels
were fashioned into shape; though
it is undoubtedly more adapted for
war than for any peaceful art.
It measures 5&frac12; inches in length,
by 3&#x2157; inches in greatest breadth;
and is apparently formed of dark greenstone. It is now in the
possession of Charles Wilsone Brown, Esq., of Wemyss, Renfrewshire,
having descended to him from a maternal relative who chanced to be
passing at the time of the discovery, and secured the curious relic.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The excavations of the following year brought a second canoe to light,
at a higher level, and still further removed from the modern river's bed.
Close to the site of Glasgow's ancient City Cross, and immediately
adjoining what was once the Tolbooth of the burgh&mdash;more memorable
from the fancied associations with which genius has endowed it, than
for the stern realities of human misery which were its true attributes&mdash;there
stands a quaint, but not inelegant building, adorned with an
arcade curiously decorated with grim or grotesque masks on the keystone
of each arch. It was erected on the site of older and less substantial
tenements, in the year 1781; and in digging for a foundation
for it, in a stratum of laminated clay that lies beneath a thick
bed of sand, another primitive British canoe was discovered, hollowed
as usual out of a single trunk of oak.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Another is noted to have
been found about 1824, in Stockwell, near Jackson Street, while
cutting the common sewer; and a fourth, at a much higher level, on
the slope of Drygate Street, immediately behind the prison.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In
1825 a fifth canoe was discovered, scarcely an hundred yards from
the site of the former at the City Cross, when digging the sewer of
London Street&mdash;a new thoroughfare opened up by the demolition of
ancient buildings long fallen to decay. This boat, which measured
about eighteen feet in length, exhibited unusual evidences of labour
and ingenuity. It was built of several pieces of oak, though without
ribs. It lay, moreover, in a singular position, nearly vertical, and
with its prow uppermost, as if it had foundered in a storm.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 541px;">
<img src="images/image035.jpg" width="541" height="299" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>To these older instances recent and large additions have been
made. The earlier discoveries seem to point to a period when the whole
lower level on the north side of the river, where the chief trade and
manufactures of Scotland are now transacted, was submerged beneath
the sea. What follows affords similar evidence in relation to the
southern bank of the Clyde. Extensive operations have been carrying
on there for some years for the purpose of enlarging the harbour
of Glasgow, and providing a range of quays on the grounds of Springfield,
corresponding to those on the older Broomielaw. There, at a
depth of seventeen feet below the surface, and about 130 feet from the
river's original brink, the workmen uncovered an ancient canoe, hewn
out of the trunk of an oak, with pointed stem, and the upright groove
remaining which had formerly held in its place the straight stern.
The discovery was made in the autumn of 1847; and the citizens
of Glasgow having for the most part a reasonable conviction that
boats lose their value in proportion to their age, the venerable relic
lay for some months unheeded, until at length the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland made application for it to the Trustees of the
River Clyde, and the rude precursor of the fleets that now crowd that
noble river is safely deposited in their museum. Meanwhile the excavators
proceeded with their labours, and in the following year
another, and then a third canoe of primitive form, were disclosed on
the southern bank of the Clyde. One of these, which has been since
removed to the Hunterian Museum, measures 19&#x2153; feet long, by 3&frac12;
feet wide at the stern, 2 feet 9&frac12; inches wide midway, and 30 inches
deep. The prow is rather neatly formed with a small cut-water, near
to which is an oblong hole, apparently for running a rope through to
anchor or secure the vessel. There had been an outrigger, which was
described by the workmen as adhering to it when first discovered,
and the holes remain for receiving the pins by which it was fastened.
About the centre are small rests inside the gunwale for the ends of a
cross seat, and others for a broader seat are at the stern, both being
projections formed by leaving the wood when the trunk was originally
hollowed out into a boat. In this example the stern remains
nearly in a perfect state. It consists of a board inserted in vertical
grooves cut in each side, and received into a horizontal groove
across, beyond which the bottom and sides project about eight inches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
The other of these two canoes was chiefly remarkable for a circular
hole in the bottom, stopped by a plug imbedded in very tenacious
clay, evidently designed to admit of water shipped being run off when
it was on shore. But the most curious, and indeed puzzling fact in
regard to it, is that this plug is not of oak but of <i>cork</i>&mdash;a discovery
suggestive of inquiries not easily answered satisfactorily.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In the month of September 1849 a fourth canoe was found at
Springfield, at a depth of about 20 feet from the surface, and in the
same bed of finely laminated clay as those already described. This,
too, is hollowed out of the single trunk of an oak, only thirteen feet
in length, but on either side of it lay two additional planks of curious
construction, each of them pierced with an elongated hole, which appeared
to have been made with some sharp tool. They indicate some
ingenious contrivance of the ancient seaman, not improbably designed
for use when the bold navigator ventured with his tiny barque into
the open sea, to be applied somewhat in the way a Dutch lugger fends
off the dashing waves from her lee. This boat differs from those previously
discovered, in having a rounded bow both fore and aft. In
some respects it might seem to be the most ancient of the whole, and
could hardly accommodate more than one man. Its workmanship is
extremely rude, and it bears obvious marks of having been hollowed
by fire. Yet the wooden appendages found alongside of it suffice to
prove that its maker was not unprovided with some efficient tools.
Thus, within a comparatively brief period, nine ancient canoes have
been found within this limited area, affording singular evidence
that in the earliest ages in which the presence of a human population
is discoverable, we also find abundant proofs of the art of navigation,
where now space fails to accommodate the merchant fleets of the
Clyde. To these notices may be added the discovery of the remains
of an ancient boat of more artificial construction, which was dug up,
about the year 1830, at Castlemilk, Lanarkshire. It measured ten
feet long, by two broad, and was built of oak, secured by large wooden
pins.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Nearly at the same time as the latest disclosures in the valley of
the Clyde, workmen cutting a drain on the farm of Kinaven, Aberdeenshire,
discovered another ancient boat of the same form as most of
those previously described, and measuring eleven feet long, by nearly
four broad. It is hewn out of the solid oak, with pointed stem, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>the stern a projection formed in the piece, and pierced with an eye,
as if to attach a mooring cable. Like the Glasgow canoes, it is
rudely finished, and exhibits the rough marks of the instrument with
which it was reduced to shape. It lay imbedded in the moss, at a
depth of five feet, at the head of a small ravine; and near it were found
the stumps and roots of several large oaks. The nearest stream, the
Ythan, is several miles off, and the sea is distant many more. A few
years previous to this discovery, a similar canoe, of still smaller
dimensions, was dug up in the moss of Drumduan, in the same
county. It is described as quite entire, and neatly formed out of a
single block of oak; but being left exposed, it was broken by the
rude handling of some idle herd-boys.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Such are a few examples of the aboriginal fleets of ancient Caledonia,
found at different dates, and in various localities, yet agreeing
wonderfully in every essential element of comparison. With them
might also be noted the frequent discovery in bogs, or in alluvial
strata, of trees felled by artificial means, and accompanied with relics
of the most primitive arts. In 1830, for example, workmen engaged
in constructing a sewer in Church Street, Inverness, found at a depth
of fourteen feet below the surface, in a stratum of stiff blue clay, numerous
large trunks of fossil oak; and along with these several deer's
horns, one of which, bearing unmistakable marks of artificial cutting,
is now deposited in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Here surely is common ground for the antiquary and
the geologist. The rude harpoon left beside the bones of the stranded
whale, far up in the alluvial valley of the Forth: the oaken querne,
the wheel and the arrow-heads: the boats beneath the City Cross of
Glasgow, the centre of a busy population for the last thousand years:
the primitive ship, as we may almost term the huge canoe on the banks
of the Carron: and the tiny craft just found near the waters of the
Ythan&mdash;all speak, in no doubtful language, of the presence of a
human population, at a period when the geographical features of the
country, and the relative levels of land and sea, must have differed
very remarkably from what we know of them at the earliest ascertained
epoch of definite history. They point to a time within the
historic era, when the ocean tides ebbed and flowed over the carse of
Stirling, at a depth sufficient to admit of the gambols of the whale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>where now a child might ford the brawling stream; and when the
broad estuary of the Clyde flung its waves to the shore, not far from
the high ground where the first cathedral of St. Mungo was founded,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 560. These evidences of population, prior to the latest geological
changes which have affected the surface of the country, are indeed
all found on old historic ground, according to the reckonings of written
chronicles. The first of them, in the south country, have been
met with in localities where the traces of Roman invasion in the second
century remain uneffaced. The carse of Falkirk is still indented
with the vallum of the Antonine wall. Its modern church preserves
the old tablet, which assigned to the ancient structure on its site a
date coeval with the founding of Scottish monarchy under Malcolm
Canmore; and the broad level ground, which has disclosed evidence
of such remarkable changes, alike in natural features and in national
arts and manners, was the battle-field of Wallace in the thirteenth
century, as of Prince Charles Edward and the Highland clansmen in
the eighteenth century. Trivet thus refers to the carse of Falkirk,
in describing the invasion of Edward I., thereby affording curious evidence
of its state at the former period,&mdash;"Causantibus majoribus <i>loca</i>
<i>palustria</i>, propter brumalem intemperiem, immeabilia esse;" on which
Lord Hailes remarks&mdash;"The meaning seems to be, that the English
could not arrive at Stirling without passing through some of the carse
grounds, and that they were impracticable for cavalry at that season
of the year."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Nor are the historic associations of the broad carse
which the Forth has intertwined with its silver links a whit behind
those of the vale of Carron. There, in all probability, Agricola
marshalled the Roman legions for his sixth campaign, and watched
the mustering of the army of Galgacus on the heights beyond. The
ever memorable field of Bannockburn adds a sacred interest to the
same soil. There, too, are the scenes of James III.'s mysterious death
on the field of Stirling, and of successive operations of Montrose,
Cromwell, Mar, and Prince Charles. But the oldest of these events,
long regarded as the beginnings of history, are modern occurrences,
when placed alongside of such as we now refer to. Guiding his
team across the "bloody field," as the scene of English slaughter
is still termed, the ploughman turns up the craw-foot, the small
Scottish horse-shoe, and the like tokens of the memorable day when
Edward's chivalry was foiled by the Scottish host. Penetrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>some few feet lower with his spade, he finds the evidences of former
changes in the level of land and sea, but with them stumbles also on
the relics of coeval population. Lower down he will reach the stratified
rocks, including the carboniferous formation, stored no less
abundantly with relics of former life and change, but no longer within
the historic period, or pertaining to the legitimate investigations of
archæological science, unless in so far as they confirm its previous
inductions, and prove the slow but well defined progress of the more
recent geological changes on the earth's surface. Such reflections are
not suggested for the first time in our own day, nor will a shallow
part satisfy those who have gone thus far. "Nature hath furnished
one part of the earth, and man another. The treasures of time lie
high, in urns, coins, and monuments, scarce below the roots of some
vegetables. Time hath endless rarities, and shows of all varieties,
which reveals old things in heaven, makes new discoveries in earth,
and even earth itself a discovery. That great antiquity, America,
lay buried for thousands of years, and a large part of the earth is
still in the urn unto us."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Some of these historic phenomena which are indicated above required
only time to produce them. The beds of sand and loam at
Springfield, in which the ancient fleets of the Clyde have lain entombed
for ages, are such as the slow depositions of winter floods will for the
most part account for, if the chronologist can only spare for them
the requisite centuries. Others seem to point to geological changes
within the historic era, of a more remarkable and extensive character.
These it is not our province to explain. Whether the geologist
find it most consistent with the established laws of his science to
assume the standing of the whole ocean at higher levels within so
recent a period, or adopt the more probable theory of local upheaval
and denudation to account for these phenomena, this at least must be
conceded, that the lapse of many ages is required for the changes
which they indicate, and we can hardly err in inferring that civilisation
had advanced but a little way on the plain of Nimroud, or the
banks of the Nile, when the tiny fleets of the Clyde were navigating
its estuary, and the hardy fishermen were following the whale in the
winding creeks of the Forth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

SEPULCHRAL MEMORIALS.</h3>


<p>The raising of sepulchral mounds of earth or stone to mark the last
resting-place of the loved or honoured dead may be traced in all
countries to the remotest periods. Their origin is to be sought for
in the little heap of earth displaced by interment, which still to
thousands suffices as the most touching memorial of the dead. In a
rude and primitive age, when the tomb of the great warrior or patriarchal
chief was to be indicated by some more remarkable token, the
increase of the little earth-mound, by the united labours of the community,
into the form of a gigantic barrow, would naturally suggest
itself as the readiest and fittest mark of distinction. In its later
circular forms we see the rude type of the great Pyramids of Egypt,
no less than of the lesser British moat-hills and other native-earth-works,
until at length, when the aspiring builders were rearing the
gigantic monoliths of Avebury, they constructed, amid the tumuli of
the neighbouring downs, the earth-pyramid of Silbury Hill, measuring
170 feet in perpendicular height, and covering an area of five acres
and thirty-four perches of land.</p>

<p>Priority has been given to the primitive relics of naval skill, which
the later alluvial strata of Scotland supply, for reasons sufficiently
obvious, and pertaining exclusively to the antiquities of our insular
home. But for the surest traces of primitive arts and a defined progress
in civilisation, the archæologist will generally turn with greater
propriety to the grave-mounds of the ancient race whose history he
seeks to recover; for, however true be "the words of the preacher,"
in the sense in which he uttered them, there is both device, and know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ledge,
and instruction in the grave, for those who seek there the
records of the dead. This fact is in itself an eloquent one in the evidence
it furnishes, that in that dim and long forgotten past, of which
we are seeking to recover the records, man was still the same, "of
like passions with ourselves," vehement in his anger, and no less
passionate in unavailing sorrow.</p>

<p>No people, however rude or debased be their state, have yet been
met with so degraded to the level of the brutes as to entertain no
notion of a Supreme Being, or no anticipation of a future state. Some
more or less defined idea of a retributive future is found in the wildest
savage creed, developing itself in accordance with the rude virtues to
which the barbarian aspires. While the luxurious Asiatic dreams of
the sensual joys of his Mohammedan elysium, the Red Indian warrior
looks forward to the range of ampler hunting-grounds, and the enjoyment
of unfailing victory on the war-path. All, however, anticipate
a corporeal participation in tangible joys, and, to the simpler mind of
the untutored savage, affection dictates the provision of means to
supply the first requisites of this new state of being. Hence the bow
and spear, the sword, shield, and other implements of war and the
chase, laid beside the rude cinerary urn, or deposited in the cist
with the buried chief. Refinement, which added to the wants and
acquirements of the warrior, in like manner furnished new means for
affection to lavish on the loved or honoured dead. Personal ornaments
were added to the indispensable weapons, that the hero might
not only stand at no disadvantage amid the novel scenes into which he
had passed, but that he might also assume the insignia of rank and
distinction which were his right. The feelings prompting to such
tributes of affectionate sorrow are innate and indestructible. They
manifest themselves under varied forms in every state of social being,
and may be readily traced amid the struggle for decorous and costly
sepulchral honours, no less universal now than in the long forgotten
era of the tumulus and cinerary urn.</p>

<p>From the contents of the tumuli we are able partially to apply to
them a relative system of chronology, the accuracy of which appears
to be satisfactorily borne out. No archæologist has yet done for any
district of Scotland what the intelligent research of Sir Richard Colt
Hoare effected for Wiltshire. No other single district, indeed, offers
the same tempting field for the study, and few archæologists possess
his ample means for carrying out such investigations. He has adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
a subdivision, which distinguishes fourteen different kinds of barrows,
classified according to their shape, and furnishes a systematic nomenclature,
which is of general avail. Observations since carried out
over a more extensive field enable us in some degree to modify this
system, and reduce the number of true barrows, while even of these
some are probably only the result of accident, or of the caprice of individual
taste. The following are the best defined among the varieties
noted by Sir R. C. Hoare:&mdash;1. The long barrow, resembling a
gigantic grave; 2. The bowl barrow, from its similarity to an inverted
bowl; 3. The bell barrow; 4. The twin barrow, consisting of two adjacent
tumuli, one of them generally larger than the other, and both
inclosed in one fosse or vallum; 5. The Druid barrow, generally a
broad and low tumulus, surrounded by a vallum. The last name was
given on insufficient evidence by Dr. Stukely, Sir R. C. Hoare's predecessor
in investigating the antiquities of Wiltshire. The latter has
subdivided the class into three varieties, and there seems some reason
to think that such indicate the place of interment of females; but
more extensive observation is required to establish so interesting an
inference. The remaining distinctions appear to be either accidental,
or referring to earth-works, certainly not sepulchral. Among this last
are the "pond barrows," hereafter referred to as the remains of primitive
dwellings, and the conical mounds or moat-hills, of which Silbury
Hill is probably the largest in the world, designed as the lofty tribunal
where the arch-priest or chief administered, and frequently
executed, the rude common law of the northern races. The laborious
excavations carried out under the direction of the Archæological Institute
during the Salisbury Congress in 1849, have at least put an
end to any ideas of Silbury Hill being a sepulchral mound.</p>

<p>Much similarity is naturally to be expected between the primitive
antiquities of England and Scotland, where the imaginary border
land that so long formed the marches between rival nations presents
no real barrier calculated to interpose an impediment to the free interchange
of knowledge or arts. Nevertheless there are many of those
distinctive peculiarities observable in Scotland which are well calculated
to encourage further investigation, though, for the purposes of
a just and logical distinction, the Scottish archæologist ought to include
the ancient kingdom of Northumbria within the region of his
researches, and draw his comparisons between the antiquities found
to the north and the south of the great wall of Severus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The barrows of Scotland, in so far as they have yet been carefully
observed, may be described as consisting of the Long Barrow; the
Bowl Barrow; the Bell Barrow; the Conoid Barrow; the Crowned
Barrow&mdash;such as that of Stoneranda in Birsa&mdash;with one or more
standing stones set upon it; the Inclosed Barrow, a circular tumulus
of the usual proportions, and most frequently also conoid in form,
but environed by an earthen vallum; and the Encircled Barrow, generally
of large proportions, and surrounded by a circle of standing stones.
The two latter are of frequent occurrence in Scotland. The evidence
of their contents indicates that they belong to a comparatively late
era, and their correspondence to some of the most common sepulchral
memorials of Norway and Sweden suggests the probability of a Scandinavian
origin. The twin barrow, with its enclosing vallum, as described
by Sir R. C. Hoare, and still to be seen in Wiltshire, does not,
I think, occur in Scotland. But it is not uncommon to find a large
and smaller tumulus placed near together, and these pairs occur so frequently,
especially in Orkney, that I incline to apply to them meanwhile
the term of twin barrows, believing them to have more than an
accidental relation to each other. This is a point, however, which can
only be satisfactorily settled by the most careful examination of their
contents. In the parish of Holm in Orkney, there is a cluster of eight
tumuli of different sizes, all inclosed within one earthen vallum. Another
group consists of one large and three smaller tumuli, surrounded
by a double ditch, with the remains of a third on one side; and occasionally
clusters of tumuli, though without any inclosing work, suggest
the probability of their vicinity being the result of design. Another
arrangement is also deserving of note, where a group of eight or nine
of these earth-mounds occur forming a continuous chain, in a nearly
straight line, and separated from one another by regular intervening
spaces. Whatever appears to indicate design in these primitive structures
is worthy of study. Wherever we can trace the motives of their
constructors, we recover some clue to the character and history of the
race.</p>

<p>The remarkable cluster of monolithic groups and earth-works at
Stennis in Orkney, includes a variety of sepulchral mounds, probably
belonging to very different periods. Scattered around the great circle,
or Ring of Broidgar, as it is commonly called, there are many tumuli
differing considerably in size and form, but all known to the peasants
under the general title of the Knowes of Broidgar. The dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of some of the largest of these were taken, during the recent Admiralty
Survey, by Lieutenant F. W. L. Thomas, R.N., the intelligent
officer in command, to whom I am indebted for the use of valuable
notes of observations on the antiquities of Orkney:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most remarkable tumulus, which is of elliptical shape, stands
at the shore of the north or fresh-water loch. It measures one hundred
and twelve feet long by sixty-six feet broad. The level ridge on the
top measures twenty-two feet in length, and its height is nearly the
same. It has been greatly destroyed by excavators at some former
period. Near to it is a small standing stone. No other tumulus of this
shape exists in Orkney. A large conoid tumulus, fifty feet in radius
and twenty-eight feet in height, stands to the westward of the great
circle, also pillaged at some former time; and in the same neighbourhood
are ten smaller tumuli of various dimensions. Five of these
are of equal size: radius six feet, height three feet, and only from two
to three feet apart; four of them in a line."</p>

<p>Besides these, there stands, at a short distance to the northward of
the elliptical tumulus, and near the shore, another large earth-work
of peculiar form, which can hardly be more definitely described than
by comparing it to a colossal plum-cake. It rises perpendicularly five
feet, and is nearly flat on the top, assuming the form of a greatly depressed
cone, the apex of which is nine feet high. The radius of the
whole measures thirty-one feet. This mound, however, is most probably
not sepulchral, but rather the platform on which a building of
wood had been reared, though its present symmetrical form may render
this doubtful. The Ring of Bookan, in the same neighbourhood,
appears to be a similar platform, but it is inclosed with an earthen
vallum, and exhibits abundant traces of ruined works on its irregular
area. Various other, though less regular mounds, of this character,
occur in Orkney. The burgh of Culswick is represented as having
stood on such a platform, the shape of which nearly corresponded with
that of Stennis when drawn in 1774, but the materials of this venerable
ruin have since furnished a quarry for the neighbouring cottars.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
It is exceedingly doubtful if the larger tumuli in the neighbourhood
of the great circle of Stennis would now repay the labour of exploring
them. They exhibit, as has been observed, abundant traces of former
investigation; and there is good reason to believe that most, if not
all of them, have already been spoiled of their historic contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Wallace remarks, in his Description of Orkney:&mdash;"In one of these
hillocks, near the circle of high stones at the north end of the Bridge
of Stennis, there were found nine fibulæ of silver, of the shape of a
horse-shoe, but round."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Unfortunately the dimensions of these silver
relics are not given; but from the engraving of one of them, it seems
more likely that they consisted chiefly of gorgets, though, in all probability,
including a variety of objects of great interest. But the
view of the great circle of Stennis, which accompanies that of the
fibula found in its neighbourhood, is sufficient to satisfy the most
credulous how little faith can be put in the engravings.</p>

<p>The most numerous and remarkable of all the Scottish sepulchral
mounds, both for number and size, are the stone tumuli or <span class="smcap">CAIRNS</span>,
many of which are works of great labour and considerable skill.
These singular monumental pyramids are by no means to be accounted
for from any local peculiarities furnishing a ready supply of loose
stones. They abound in almost every district of the country, and are
frequently of much larger dimensions than the earthen tumuli, though
the nature of their materials has led to the destruction of many of
them in the progress of inclosing lands for agricultural purposes. We
learn from the Book of Joshua of the practice of raising heaps of
stone over the dead as a mark of indignity or abhorrence. The contents
of the Scottish sepulchral cairns, however, prove for them an
altogether different origin, as will appear when we come to review
them in detail. They are generally designed on a larger scale than
the earthen tumuli, and must have ranked at a remote period among
the most distinguished honours awarded to the illustrious dead.</p>

<p>Another remarkable, though much rarer sepulchral monument, is
the Cromlech, or "Druidical altar," as it was long erroneously termed,
until archæologists, abandoning theory for observation, discovered
that these huge monolithic structures invariably marked the sites of
ancient sepulture. Similar primitive colossal structures are found,
not only throughout the whole British Isles, but in many parts of the
continent of Europe, and are occasionally discovered, like the slighter
cist, entombed beneath the earth-pyramid or tumulus, affording thereby
singular evidence of the unostentatious liberality with which the
honours of the dead were rendered in the olden time to which they
belong.</p>

<p>The Wiltshire of Scotland, in so far as the mere number of sepul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>chral
mounds, along with monolithic groups and other aboriginal
structures, can constitute this distinction, is the mainland of Orkney,
with one or two of the neighbouring isles. Few of their contents,
however, have proved of the same valuable character as those which
have been discovered not only in Aberdeenshire, Fifeshire, and some
of the southern Lowland counties, but also in the Western Isles. We
are therefore led to infer that the population of Orkney has been
little more distinguished for wealth, or great advancement in the arts,
during its earlier history than in more recent times. Abundant evidence,
however, testifies to the occupation of these islands by a human
population at a very remote era, and no Scottish locality ever furnished
a greater variety of interesting relics of the primeval period.
In the single parish of Sandwick, near Stromness, upwards of an hundred
tumuli of different sizes have been observed, many of which have
been recently opened, and their contents described. In the parish of
Orphir, in like manner, considerable research has been made into the
character and contents of these ancient memorials; while throughout
nearly the whole of the neighbouring islands, the mosses and moors
which have escaped the obliterating inroads of the ploughshare, are
covered with similar monumental heaps.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted that such relics of ancient population were
once no less common throughout the whole mainland of Scotland, and
especially in the fertile districts of the low country, where the earliest
traces of a numerous population may reasonably be sought for. A
sufficient number still remain in Fife and the Lothians, as well as in
the southern counties, to afford means of comparison with other localities;
while numerous discoveries of cists, urns, and ancient implements,
leave no room to doubt that the same race once occupied the
whole island, and practised similar arts and rites in the long cultivated
districts of the low country, as in the remotest of the northern or
western isles.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that extended observation may justify a more
minute classification of the primitive sepulchral monuments of Scotland
than has been attempted above, and may establish a relative
chronological arrangement of them on a satisfactory basis. With our
present imperfect knowledge, any theoretic system would only embarrass
future inquiry. But meanwhile it may assist in forming a
basis for further operations, to note the following attempts at systematic
arrangement from such data as are available.</p>

<p>1. The Scottish long barrow, which is generally somewhat depressed
in the centre, and more elevated towards one end than the other,
may be assumed with little hesitation as one of the earliest forms of
sepulchral earth-works. It is now comparatively rare. As the work
of a thinly scattered population, it is probable that examples of it
were never very numerous, and of these we may perhaps assume
that the greater number have been gradually obliterated by structures
of more recent date. So far as I am aware, no metallic implements
have ever been found in the Scottish long barrow. Examples
of pottery are also of very rare occurrence, and it is doubtful if
any of these have furnished instances of the presence of the cinerary
urn and its imperfectly burned contents in the primeval sepulchres.
It is rather indeed from the absence of traces of art or ingenuity
that we may most satisfactorily assign to this class of mounds the
priority in point of antiquity. The form of the long barrow seems
in itself to suggest the probability of an earlier origin than the circular
tumulus, since it is only an enlargement of the ordinary grave-mound
which naturally results from the displacement of the little
space of earth occupied by the body, and in this respect strikingly
corresponds with the most primitive ideas of a distinctive sepulchral
memorial&mdash;a larger mound to mark that of the chief or priest,
from the encircling heaps of common graves. In a long barrow
opened in the neighbourhood of Port Seaton, East-Lothian, in 1833,
a skeleton was found laid at full length within a rude cist. It indicated
the remains of a man nearly seven feet high, but the bones
crumbled to dust soon after their exposure to the air.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> One of the
largest Scottish earth-works of this primitive form is that already
referred to, situated on the margin of the loch of Stennis, in the
vicinity of the celebrated Orcadian Stonehenge. It is the only long
barrow on the mainland of Orkney, but its form and proportions differ
considerably from those commonly met with. It seems probable that
this belongs to a late era, and owes its origin to the same Norwegian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>source as the neighbouring conoid earth pyramids that tower above
the bowl barrows of the aboriginal Orcadians.</p>

<p>At a very early date, undoubtedly within the primitive era to which
we give the name of the Stone Period, but apparently only towards
its close, the practice of cremation was introduced. This, however,
is one of the many points that must be left for final determination
when a greater number of accurate and trustworthy observations
have been accumulated. Meanwhile it may be assumed as
unquestionable, that simple inhumation is the most ancient of all
modes of disposing of the dead, and we possess abundant evidence
of its use in this country, apparently by the earliest colonists
of whom any definite traces now exist. We are not without proof
that there was a long transition-period after the remarkable change
consequent on the acquisition of metals, before the stone implements
and arts were completely superseded by those of bronze; and it is to
this era we shall most probably have to assign the first practice of
cremation. Both the introduction of the metallurgic arts and the
change of sepulchral rites may indeed be equally supposed to mark
the influence, if not the advent, of a new race. In nearly every state
of society the burial of the dead is associated with the most sacred
tenets of religion, and its wonted rites are among the very last to be
affected by change. It accords therefore with all analogy that the
source of so remarkable a change should come from without, and
accompany other equally important social revolutions. It will be seen
in a succeeding chapter, that some of the very rudest and apparently
most primitive of cinerary urns yet found in Scotland have been
associated with undoubted proofs of their connexion with the bronze
period. But it has not hitherto been the prevailing fault of British
antiquaries to assign too remote an era to the introduction of the
funeral pile. It has rather been one of the endless blunders springing
from the too exclusively classical nature of modern education, to assume
for it a Roman origin, and to accept the urn as an evidence of
Roman influence and example, even where it was owned to be the
product of native art. If, however, we make sufficient allowance for
the poetical preference of the funeral fire and the inurned ashes,
rather than the simple and more common rite, and so decline to receive
some of the allusions of Virgil and Ovid as historic evidence of
the ancient usage of the former by the Romans, we shall find good
reason for inferring that the funeral pile should rank among the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
introductions of Roman luxury, derived in all probability from the
Greeks, by whom it was used at a very early period. The oldest
accounts indeed which we possess of the sepulchral honours of the
funeral pile, the urn, and the monumental tumulus, are the descriptions
of the funeral rites of Patroclus and Hector in the Iliad. The
whole circumstances are characterized by much simple grace and
beauty:&mdash;the burning of the body during the night, the libations of
wine with which the embers were quenched at the dawn, the inurning
of the ashes of the deceased, and the methodic construction of the
pyramid of earth which covered the sacred deposit, and preserved
the memory of the honoured dead.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The testimony of Pliny, on the
contrary, is most distinct as to the introduction of a similar practice
among the Romans at a comparatively late period.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Independent of the consideration of Roman usage, it is unquestionable
that the funeral pile must have been in use in the British
Isles for many generations before the era of the Roman Invasion, if
not indeed before that of Rome's mythic founder. But the evidence
of the Scottish tumuli, while it proves the ancient practice of
cremation, shows also the contemporaneous custom of inhumation;
nor is it possible, so far as I can see, to determine from the amount
of evidence yet obtained, that one of these was esteemed more honourable
than the other.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It is not, indeed, uncommon for the larger
tumuli to contain a single cist, with the inhumed remains untouched
by fire, and around it, at irregular intervals, several cinerary urns,
sometimes varying in size and style, but all containing the half-burned
bones and ashes of the dead. The inference which such an
arrangement suggests would seem to point to inhumation as the more
honourable rite; but even where either inhumation or cremation has
been the sole mode of disposing of the bodies, we still detect obvious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>marks of distinction, and of superior honours conferred on one or
more of the occupants of the tumulus. In one of the largest of a
numerous group of tumuli near Stromness, in Orkney, which was
opened by the Rev. Charles Clouster, minister of Sandwick, in 1835,
evidences of six separate interments were found, all so disposed on
the original soil, and in contact with each other, as scarcely to admit
of doubt that the whole had taken place prior to the formation of the
earthen mound beneath which they lay. Two large and carefully
constructed cists occupied the centre, and contained burnt bones, but
without urns; while around these were four other cists, extremely
rude, and greatly inferior both in construction and dimensions. In
such we probably should recognise the family cemetery,&mdash;the two
larger and more important cists containing, it may be, the chief and
his wife, and the surrounding ones their children, or favourite dependents,
or perhaps their slaves.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting examples which have been accurately
observed of simple interment accompanied with urns and relics entirely
belonging to the primitive period, was discovered on the opening
of a small tumulus in the parish of Cruden, Aberdeenshire. Within
it was found a cist containing two skeletons nearly entire. One of
these was that of an adult, while the other appeared to have been a
youth of twelve or thirteen years of age, in addition to which there
were also portions of the skeleton of a dog. Beside them stood
two rude clay urns, slightly ornamented with encircling lines, but
containing no incinerated remains; and within the cist were found
seven flint arrow-heads, two flint knives, and a polished stone, similar
to one now in the Scottish Museum, which is described in a succeeding
chapter. It is slightly convex on one side, and concave on the
other, with small holes drilled at the four corners, by which it would
seem to have been attached, most probably, to the dress, as an article
of personal adornment. These curious relics are now in the collection
of Adam Arbuthnot, Esq., of Peterhead.</p>

<p>Cæsar relates of the Gauls that they burned their honoured dead,
consuming along with them not only the things they most esteemed
when alive, but also their dogs and horses, and their favourite servants
and retainers.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Without any reference to this remarkable
passage, it is scarcely possible to overlook the evidence which suggests
the idea of some such Suttee system having prevailed among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>the aboriginal Britons, when observing the opening of a large tumulus,
as it discloses its group of cists or urns, or of both combined.
It seems hardly reconcilable with the general customs or ideas of a
primitive community, to suppose that the earthen pyramid was systematically
husbanded by its ancient builders like a modern family
vault, or disturbed anew for repeated interments, unless by those who
had lost all remembrance of its original object. Towards the close of
the Pagan era, and in that transition-period which extends in Scotland
from the fifth to about the ninth century, during which the
rites of the new faith were still blended with older Pagan customs,
it was no doubt different, and regular cemeterial tumuli are found,
which must have accumulated during a considerable period. These,
however, differ essentially from the earlier tumuli; and if we are to
suppose the whole group of urns or cists in the latter to have been
deposited at once, it is difficult to conceive of any other mode of accounting
for this than the one already suggested, which is so congenial
to the ideas of barbarian rank, and of earthly distinctions
perpetuated beyond the grave. Instances do indeed occur both of
cists and urns found in large tumuli near the surface, and so far apart
from the main sepulchral deposit as to induce the belief that they
may have been inserted at a subsequent period; while the large
chambered tumuli and cairns must be supposed to have been the
burial-places of a tribe or sept. It must not be overlooked that the
tumuli are not, in general, to be regarded as common graves, but as
special monumental structures reserved alone for the illustrious dead;
among whom, no doubt, were reckoned those who fell in battle, and
over whom we may therefore conceive the surviving victors to have
erected those gigantic cairns which are occasionally found to cover a
multitude of the dead. But some of the Scottish cairns which have
been found only to inclose a solitary cist, must have occupied the
labour of months, and required the united exertions of a numerous
corps of workmen, to gather the materials, and pile them up into
such durable and imposing monuments.</p>

<p>The remembrance of how greatly the dead of a few generations
outnumber the living, would alone suffice to show that the tumuli
could not be common sepulchral mounds. Such a custom universally
adopted for a few generations in a populous district, would surpass
the effects of deluges and earthquakes, in the changes wrought by it
on the natural surface of the ground. The laws of Solon interdicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the raising of tumuli on account of the extent of land they occupied;
and the Romans enacted the same prohibitory restrictions prior to
the time of Cicero. We are familiar with the common modes of
British sepulture, contemporaneous with the monumental tumulus;
both the cist and the urn being very frequently found without any
artificial increase of the superincumbent soil to mark the spot where
they are deposited. Their inhumation beneath the soil, as well as
the frequent occurrence of numbers together, point them out as the
common and undistinguished graves of the builders of the tumuli.
Where the tumulus was to be superimposed no such interment took
place. The cist was constructed on the natural surface of the soil,
and over this, earth brought from a distance&mdash;or occasionally cut
away from the surface immediately surrounding the chosen site, so as
thereby to add to its height&mdash;was heaped up and moulded into the
accustomed form. In its progress the accompanying urns were disposed,
frequently with little attention to regularity, in the inclosed
area; nor is it uncommon to find along with these the bones of domestic
animals. In the later tumuli are occasionally found the bronze
bridle-bit and other horse furniture, and sometimes teeth and bones,
and even the entire skeleton of the horse. The skeleton of the dog
is still more frequently met with: and it is to be regretted that in
Scotland the fact has hitherto been recorded without any minute observations
being attempted on the skeleton, from which to ascertain its
species, and perhaps thereby trace the older birthland of its master.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The Rev. Alexander Low, in a communication laid before the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1815, refers to the entire skeleton of a
horse discovered interred between two cists, where a large cairn had
been demolished in the parish of Cairnie, Aberdeenshire. Other examples
will come under our notice, all indicating the prevalence
of the custom above referred to, so consonant with barbarian ideas of
rank, and with the rude conceptions of a future state which still
linger in parts of the Asiatic continent, where the philologist has
traced the evidences of a common origin with the wandering tribes
that found their way across the continent of Europe and peopled the
British Isles. This, however, in passing: the reader will find no
difficulty in separating fact from fancy when judging for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The Long Barrow has been stated to belong apparently to the
rude primeval period; but the number of examples which have been
carefully examined are still too few to admit of very positive conclusions
being assumed. A remarkable group of Scottish long barrows
occurs in the immediate neighbourhood of the Pass of Keltnie,
Perthshire. One of them was opened in 1837, and found to contain
unburnt bones, along with which were discovered several rude horn
lance-heads and pieces of bone artificially cut. The state of preservation
in which these were, when compared with the rapid decay of
the human remains almost immediately on their exposure to the air,
opens up an interesting inquiry in relation to these primitive sepulchral
deposits. The very different conditions in which the contiguous
bones are found seem at first sight incompatible with the idea of
their having been deposited along with the original occupants of the
barrow. But the fragile texture of the human skeleton, when compared
with that of the lower animals, is well known. Professor
Goodsir informs me that his investigations have led him to the direct
conclusion that the bones of the lower animals decay much less rapidly
than those of man. The state of the skeletons of dogs and
horses found in the tumuli confirms this conclusion, which is probably
sufficiently accounted for by the greater delicacy of structure characterizing
the human osteology. But independently of this, bone
implements finished and deposited in a cist or tumulus in a perfect
state, would be much less directly exposed to the influences affecting
the skeleton amid the decomposition of the vascular tissues. It may
be noted along with these observations on early tumuli, that a large
conical cairn in the vicinity of the long barrows of Keltnie was demolished
in 1836. It contained eleven cists, several of which inclosed
cinerary urns, but no metallic relics were found in them.</p>

<p>The change to the circular tumulus is not accompanied with any
indications of alteration in the arts of its constructors. Stone weapons
and implements are of frequent occurrence in the latter, and particularly
in the bowl barrow, though no distinctive evidence has yet
been noted in relation to the most common forms of tumuli, sufficiently
marked to be resolved into any general rule, save the very
natural and obvious one, that the larger ones appear from their contents
to be the more important. It is manifest, however, that some
art was always exercised in giving to the tumulus an artificial form.
Neither the bowl nor the bell shape is that which earth naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
assumes when thrown up into a heap. The form is therefore a matter
worthy of further observation, and may yet prove a legitimate
basis of stricter classification in reference to the era or race, than that
now attempted. The bell-shaped tumuli are not very common in
Scotland, but where they do occur they are generally of the larger
class, though not always distinguished by any marked peculiarity in
their contents. Such was found to be the case on opening the Black
Knowe, which appears from a drawing of it to be a bell-shaped tumulus,
and is one of the most remarkable for size in the parish of
Rendale, Orkney. It was explored in February 1849 by Mr. George
Petrie, a zealous Orkney antiquary, in company with Lieutenant
Thomas, R.N., while engaged in the Admiralty Survey. I am informed,
however, by the latter, that its shape was by no means uniform,
and viewed from some points it differed little from the common
bowl barrow, of which it is computed that above two thousand are
still to be found scattered over the Orkney Islands alone. In the
centre and on a level with the natural surface of the soil, there was
found a small chamber or cist of undressed stones, measuring eighteen
by twelve inches, and containing only an extremely rude cinerary
urn, filled with bones and ashes mixed with clay.</p>

<p>Both the Enclosed and the Encircled Barrows are frequently of large
dimensions, and indicate by their contents that they belong to the
later era, when the metallurgic arts had been introduced. In various
instances the contents of the enclosed barrow, or tumulus surrounded
with an earthen vallum, clearly prove it to belong to the Roman era.
In one, for example, in the neighbourhood of Rutherglen, Lanarkshire,
which measured 260 feet in circumference, a gallery or long chamber
was discovered, constructed of unhewn stones, and containing, among
other relics, two brass vessels, which from the description appear to
have been Roman patellæ. On the handle of each of them was engraved
the name <span class="smcap">Congallus</span> or <span class="smcap">Convallus</span>. With these were deposited
various native relics, including a perforated stone and three large
glass beads, such as are frequently found in earlier British tumuli.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Examples, however, are not wanting of the enclosed barrow with
contents belonging to an earlier period. One of such formed the
largest of a group which occupied the summit of one of the Cathkin
hills in the parish of Kilbride. It measured eighteen feet in height,
and one hundred and twenty feet in diameter, and bore the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Queen Mary's Law, from a popular tradition that the hapless Mary
watched from its summit the ebbing tide of her fortunes on the fatal
field of Langside. This interesting memorial, thus associated with
two widely severed periods of Scottish history, afforded building materials
to the district for many years, until in 1792 some workmen
while employed in removing stones from it, exposed to view a vault or
chamber situated towards the west side of the mound, and containing
twenty-five rude cinerary urns. They were placed, as is most usual in
the earlier sepulchres, with their mouths downward, and underneath
each urn lay a piece of white quartz. Exactly in the centre of the
cairn a rude cist was discovered measuring nearly four feet square, and
among a quantity of human bones which surrounded it were two rude
fibulæ of mixed metal, and an armilla or ring of cannel coal. Another
fibula and an equally rude metal comb were found in one of the urns.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The Crowned and the Encircled Barrows closely resemble a class of
monuments which abound in Sweden and Denmark, while they are
of rare occurrence in England. In the "Samlingar f&ouml;r Nordens
Forn&auml;lskare,"<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> a variety of examples of both have been engraved;
some of which have a second circle of stones placed about half-way
up the mound, and a large standing stone on the summit. Such correspondence,
however, is not necessarily a proof of Scandinavian
origin, nor do they occur most frequently in districts of Scotland
where the long residence or frequent incursions of the Norwegians
would lead us to expect Scandinavian remains. In a large encircled
barrow called Huly Hill, opened in 1830, at Old Liston, a few miles to
the west of Edinburgh, a bronze spear-head was found along with a
heap of animal charcoal and small fragments of bones, but neither
cist nor urn. A solitary standing stone, measuring about nine and a
half feet in height, occupies a neighbouring field, a little to the east of
it. Another barrow which stood near the Abbey of Newbattle, East-Lothian,
was of a conical form, measuring thirty feet in height, and
ninety feet in circumference at the base. It formed a prominent and
beautiful object in that noble demesne, surrounded at its base with a
circle of standing stones, and crowned on the summit with a large fir-tree.
On its removal to make way for some additions to the Abbey, it
was found to contain a cist nearly seven feet long, enclosing a human
skeleton. A remarkable skull preserved in the Edinburgh Phrenological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Museum, and described as found in a stone coffin in a tumulus
opened at Newbattle in 1782, appears to belong to this memorial mound.</p>

<p>One other remarkable form of barrow occasionally, though very
rarely, found in Scotland, in all probability owes its origin to the
Vikings who invaded and colonized our coasts at the close of the Pagan
period. This consists of an oblong mound of larger size than the primitive
long barrow, and terminating in a point at both ends. Some
examples are also inclosed with stones, having one of considerable size
at each end; and from their rarity and their remarkable resemblance
to the <i>Skibss&#339;tninger</i>, or ship barrow of Sweden, there can be little
hesitation in assigning to them a Scandinavian origin. One of these
encircled ship barrows was only demolished a few years since, on the
farm of Graitney Mains, Dumfriesshire, but no record of its contents
has been preserved. A much more celebrated one, and, according to
venerable traditions, of undoubted native origin, is the Mound of St.
Columba, at <i>Port a Churaich</i>, or the Bay of the Boat, which is believed
to mark the spot where the Saint first landed on Iona. It
measures about fifty feet in length, and is supposed to be a model of
St. Columba's <i>currach</i>, or boat made of wicker and hides, built by
him in commemoration of his landing on the sacred isle. An upright
stone formerly stood at each end, and near to it is a smaller mound,
representing, as is said, the little boat towed astern. In all probability
an investigation of the contents of this traditional memorial
would prove its sepulchral character, as has been found to be the case
in other Scottish ship barrows.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> These singular tumuli are described
by Chalmers as "oblong ridges, like the hulk of a ship, with its
bottom upwards." But it appears from the investigations of northern
antiquaries, that this sepulchral monument was not only the mimic
representation of the Vikings' ship, but that the contents of the Scandinavian
<i>Skibss&#339;tninger</i> seem to confirm the assertion of their sagas,
that these warriors of the deep were sometimes literally burnt in their
ships, and the form of the favourite scene of their triumphs renewed
in the earth-work that covered their ashes.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>To this class probably belongs a very large earth-work, styled the
Hill of Rattray, Perthshire, and perhaps also another of still larger
dimensions, called Terrnavie, in the parish of Dunning, in the same
county. It is a mound of earth, resembling a ship with the keel
uppermost, and occupying several acres of ground. The name ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>pears
to be a corruption of terræ navis, or earth-ship, given to it on
account of its form. Superstition has conferred a sacredness on it,
by the association of legends evidently of primitive character. It is
told that a profane hind, having proceeded to cut turfs on the side of
the Terrnavie, was suddenly appalled by the vision of an old man,
who appeared in the opening he had made, and after demanding, with
an angry countenance and voice, why he was tirring (unroofing) his
house over his head, as suddenly vanished.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Remains of ancient
armour were dug up a few years ago, on the farm of Rossie, a little
to the east of Terrnavie; of these "two helmets, a small hatchet of
yellow metal, and a finger ring, are preserved in Duncruib House."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The barrow was not, in all probability, entirely superseded until
some time after the introduction of Christianity into Scotland.
Several examples seem to indicate that the Anglo-Saxons were wont
to convert an accumulating barrow into the general place of sepulture
of a locality, interring the body apparently in its ordinary robes, but
without any cist. Such appears to have been the tumular cemetery at
Lamel Hill, near York, of which a minute account is given by Dr. Thurnam,
in the Archæological Journal; and such also was a large sepulchral
mound, levelled near the beach at North Berwick, East-Lothian, in
1847, in preparing a site for new gas-works. The latter was in the immediate
vicinity of what appears to have been used as a general burial
ground probably till a late medieval era, but its contents were clearly
referrible to the Anglo-Saxon period; while in the same neighbourhood
many cists and other relics of still older races have been found. This
last adaptation of the primitive memorial mound as the cemetery of a
whole race, ere it was abandoned along with the creed to which it had
been allied, is thus beautifully referred to in the description by Dorban,
an ancient Irish poet, of the <i>Relec na Riogh</i>, the place of interment
of the kings of the Scotic race, of which the last Pagan monarch was
killed in the year 406.</p>

<p>Of all the more remarkable Scottish sepulchral memorials, the Cairn
is most frequently found, scattered through many districts, and corresponding
in form to nearly every class of the earthen tumuli.
So common, indeed, are cairns in many parts of the country, that
they give names to the farms on which they stand, the prefix or
termination, cairn, being of very frequent occurrence in such designations
of property, particularly in Aberdeenshire. The cairn appears
to have been completely incorporated with the ideas of the people,
from the remotest period of the rude stone implements, to the close of
Pagan customs and sepulchral rites, and is justly described as a Celtic
monument. Its name, <i>kærn</i>, is a primitive term, literally signifying
heaps of stones.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Dr. Jamieson traces it back to the Hebrew <i>kern</i>, a
horn, also applied to a hill. In the agreement between Jacob and
Laban, we see an example of the standing stone and cairn, the "pillar
and heap," employed as the memorials of a covenant by the Hebrew
patriarch. In the sepulture of Achan and of Absalom we have
examples of the cairn as a mark of obloquy and contempt; but no
traces of such associations are discoverable in Scotland, unless in
very recent times. Occasionally we meet with examples of the pillar
and heap united in a memorial cairn, as in one of large dimensions,
situated at the junction of two roads, near the village of Fowlis,
Perthshire, which is surmounted by a large standing stone, corresponding
to the barrows, for which the distinctive appellation of
crowned tumuli is suggested. The estimation of the cairn as an
honourable memorial of the dead, is proved not only by the valuable
contents, more frequently discovered in cairns than in any other
Scottish sepulchral mounds, but also by the associations which popular
tradition has preserved. A proverbial expression, still in use among
the Scottish Highlanders, is <i>Curri mi clach er do cuirn</i>, I will add
a stone to your cairn: <i>i.e.</i>, I will honour your memory when you
are gone. The conical cairn must have been in use in Scotland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>during a longer period than any other sepulchral memorial. It undoubtedly
belongs to the Stone Period, during which it was frequently
constructed of proportions no less gigantic than in later eras,
and much greater than any contemporary earthen tumulus. But
it appears to have been the favourite and most distinguished sepulchral
memorial of the aboriginal races, throughout the whole three
periods into which archæologists divide the long era prior to the
revolutions effected by Roman civilisation and the introduction of
Christianity. Cairns are either still found, or are known to have
existed, in nearly every parish of Scotland. Many of these have been
works of great labour, being regularly built of stones of considerable
size, and approaching more to the character of a constructive
pyramid, than of a mere stone tumulus or heap. Their form is most
frequently conical, but several varieties occur, including occasionally,
though rarely, the primitive shape of the long barrow. Ure describes
two of this form, which were situated in the parish of Baldernoch,
Stirlingshire, near a large cromlech, which still exists, styled, <i>The auld</i>
<i>wives' lift</i>. The largest of these cairns measured sixty yards in
length, and only ten yards in breadth. On its demolition it was found
to cover a sepulchral chamber of about four feet in breadth, constructed
of rows of broad stones set on edge, covered with large flat stones,
and containing numerous human remains. In the other long cairn,
which was opened in 1792, a similar chamber enclosed both urns and
human bones. Various other cairns still remain unopened in the
same district; and many of equal magnitude are to be met with
in different parts of the country. The well-known antiquary, Mr.
Joseph Train, furnishes an interesting account of several remarkable
cairns in the parish of Minniegaff, Kirkcudbrightshire. One of these,
called <i>Drumlawhinnie</i>, on the moor of Barcly, measures 891 feet in
circumference. Another of equal dimensions, called the <i>Boss Cairns</i>,
on the moor of Dranandow, which has been partially demolished to
construct the neighbouring field inclosures, contains a sepulchral
inclosure, similar to the cruciform chambers found in several of the
most celebrated gigantic Irish cairns. It measures internally eighty
feet in length, from the corresponding limbs of the cross each way,
while it is only four feet wide and about three feet high. The stones
in the middle of the cairn are very large, and are laid in regular
courses, from the bottom to a considerable height, and become gradually
smaller as they recede from the centre. The chamber of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<i>Grey Cairn</i>, on the neighbouring Drum of Knockman, closely resembles
this in form and dimensions, and various others occur in the district.
In one of them, called the <i>White Cairn</i>&mdash;which furnished a safe concealment
to the Laird of Glencaird and his two sons, when pursued
by Claverhouse for harbouring some of the persecuted Covenanters&mdash;some
of the stones used in constructing the internal chamber are
upwards of a ton weight each.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Pennant has preserved a variety of
interesting details of the contents of cairns opened towards the close
of last century. In one described by him on the hill of Down, near
Banff, a chamber was found containing a large ornamented Celtic urn,
with three smaller plain ones disposed around it. The whole were
filled with ashes and burnt bones, in addition to which were flint
arrow-heads, and two bone implements. Thirteen of the arrow-heads,
and one of the implements, were found in the large central urn.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In
two cairns in the parish of Tynron, Dumfriesshire, more recently
opened, there were found cists, each of which contained fragments of
bone, and a stone hammer.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Similar relics have been found in the
cairns of Wigtonshire, where these sepulchral monuments are so
numerous, that forty-nine have been counted in the small valley of
Barnair. There is, indeed, no lack of abundant testimony to prove
the erection of some of the largest Scottish cairns during the Stone
Period. Others of later eras are equally common.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir John Clerk of Pennycuick communicated to Roger Gale, Esq., in 1726, a
very interesting account of five cairns, opened and examined by himself or his
friends, in different parts of Scotland. One at Bruntone, in the parish of Pennycuick,
Mid-Lothian, contained only two cists, each about two feet in length, but
without urns or relics. Another in Ayrshire contained human bones, apparently
of a number of men, which had been partially subjected to fire, and beside them
lay a flint adze, or axe-head. The contents of the third, which was also in the
west of Scotland, are thus described:&mdash;"Some urns, placed on the top and about
the sides of it, as well as some principal urns at the bottom, over which it had
been raised. Large bones of horses and oxen, confusedly scattered among the
stones and rubbish. The head of a spear, half melted by fire, and several other
brass instruments, which had likewise suffered in the fire, and could not be well
known."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The others, which were situated, one at Pennycuick, Mid-Lothian, and
the other in Galloway, appear to have been native cairns, contemporary with the
Roman invasion,&mdash;thus furnishing a series of examples of the Scottish cairn pertaining
to each of the Pagan eras of our national history.</p></div>

<p>In the year 1828 a remarkable cairn was opened on Airswood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Moss, Dumfriesshire, by a party of labourers, when seeking for stones
with which to build a "march dyke," or boundary wall. The cairn
consisted, as usual, of a heap of loose stones, surrounded by a ring
of larger stones, closely set together. These formed a regular circle,
measuring fifty-four feet in diameter. Its form, however, was singular.
For about fourteen feet from the inner side of the encircling
stones it rose gradually, but above this the angle of elevation abruptly
changed, and the centre was formed into a steep cone. Directly
underneath this a cist was found, lying north and south, composed of
six large unhewn stones, and measuring in the interior four feet two
inches in greatest length, with a depth of two feet. It contained
only human bones, indicating a person of large stature, laid with the
head towards the north. The further demolition of the cairn disclosed
a curious example of regular internal construction on a systematic
plan. From the four corners of the central cist there extended, in
the form of a saltire, or St. Andrew's cross, rows of stones overlapping
each other like the slating of a house. At the extremity of one of
these, distant about fourteen feet from the central cist, another was
found of corresponding structure and dimensions, but laid at right
angles to the radiating row of stones. Another is said to have been
found at the extremity of one of the opposite limbs of the cross; and
it seems most probable that the whole four were originally conjoined
to corresponding cists, but a considerable portion of one side of the
cairn had been removed before attention was directed to the subject.
Between the limbs of the cross a quantity of bones, in a fragmentary
state, were strewn about.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Such a disposition of a group of cists,
under a large cairn, though rare, is not without a parallel, and may
perhaps be found characteristic of a class. The Rev. Harry Robertson
of Kiltearn describes one in that parish, about thirty paces in diameter,
which contained a central cist three and a half feet long, and
at the circumference on the east, south, and west sides, three others
of similar dimensions. As the cairn was in this case also imperfect,
and partly demolished, it is not improbable that a fourth, on the
north side, may have been previously destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Here, as in the
tumuli with cinerary urns surrounding the central cist, the group of
urns in the cairn on the hill of Down, and in numerous other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>stances,
we find a singular arrangement, apparently designed as
subservient to the honours lavished on some distinguished chief.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable groups of cairns in Scotland associated
with other primitive monuments, occurs on a small plain washed by the
River Nairn, about a mile to the east of the field of Culloden. The
whole plain, for upwards of a mile in extent, is covered over with
large cairns, encircled by standing stones surrounding them at uniform
intervals. Numerous circular groups or "Druidical Temples"
occur in the same neighbourhood, with single monoliths and detached
circles of small stones, scarcely visible amid the thick covering
of grass and heath, but indicating, in all probability, the sites of
ancient dwellings of the cairn-builders. An interesting natural
chronometer is of frequent occurrence in connexion with these rude
memorials of primitive habits, furnishing unmistakable evidence of
the remoteness of the era to which they belong, and supplying data
which may hereafter prove to be reducible to definite computation.
The accumulation, not only of alluvium, but of peat-moss over the
structures of early art, has already been referred to in describing
the ancient boats, harpoons, &amp;c., discovered in various localities. It
will repeatedly recur in the course of our inquiry in relation to
various classes of memorials of the past. The traveller, in passing
from Bunaw Ferry, on Loch Etive, to Beregonium, Argyleshire,
passes over an extensive moor, known by the name of the "Black
Moss." On this, or rather rising up through it, are several large
cairns, with here and there the remains of others which have been
demolished for the purpose of inclosing fields or building cottages.
In various parts considerable portions of the moss have been cleared
away, exposing, at a depth of from eight to ten feet, the original soil
upon which these sepulchral mounds have been reared, and bringing
to light other interesting memorials of their builders, hereafter referred
to. With such evidence of the slow growth of centuries obliterating
the traces of primitive occupation, and effecting such
changes on the natural features of the country, it is no vague conjecture
which refers to an early era the period when this wild and
barren moor was the scene of life and intelligence, and, it may be, of
many useful arts. Along with these may be mentioned another
group of cairns, including one of unusually large dimensions, not inclosed
by the gathered moss of ages, but surrounded by the encroaching
tide, on the north shore of the Frith of Beauly, Ross-shire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
affording no less striking, though diverse evidence of the remote era
to which they belong. In one of these sepulchral urns have been
found, leaving no room to doubt of their monumental character. The
largest stands about 400 yards within flood-mark; and an ingenious
writer in the Philosophical Transactions arrives at the conclusion
that an area of fully ten miles square, now flooded by the advancing
tide, has once been the site of the dwellings of the ancient cairn-builders.
Thus is it, while Time is sweeping away the hoar relics of
the past, the traces of his footprints enable us occasionally to return
upon his track, and learn how great is the interval that separates
our present from the era of their birth-time.</p>

<p>Ure, in his History of Rutherglen and Kilbride, furnishes interesting
notices of various large cairns demolished during last century,
some of which have already been referred to. One of these, which
long served as a quarry for an extensive district of the latter parish,
was termed Knocklegoil Cairn,&mdash;<i>Knoc-kill-goill</i>, the hill of the cell, or
grave, of the strangers. Some thousands of cart-loads of stones were
taken from it, in the course of which various cinerary urns were removed
or destroyed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another, called Herlaw, (the memorial mound,) was of still larger dimensions.
"Some thousand cart-loads of stones have, at different times, been taken from it;
and some thousands yet remain. Many urns with fragments of human bones were
found in one corner of it. It is still about twelve feet in height, and covers a base
of seventy feet in diameter; but this must have been far short of its dimensions
when entire."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The name of this gigantic cairn is still attached to the farm of
Harelaw, on which it stood, but the last remains of the pile were removed about
the year 1808, and a small group of trees now occupies its site. Such details
might be multiplied to almost any amount, but one other remarkable cairn may be
noted:&mdash;"On the hill above the moor of Ardoch," says Gordon, "are two great
heaps of stones, the one called <i>Cairnwochel</i>, the other <i>Cairnlee</i>. The former of these
is the greatest curiosity of the kind that I ever met with; the quantity of great
rough stones, lying above one another, almost surpasses belief, which made me have
the curiosity to measure it; and I found the whole heap to be about 182 feet in
length, thirty in sloping height, and forty-five in breadth at the bottom."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Since
these measurements were made the cairn has been opened, and within it was
found a cist, containing, according to the account of the parish minister, the
skeleton of a man seven feet long.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p></div>

<p>As we are reasonably led to conclude that the tumuli and cairns
were mostly constructed at one time, as monuments, and not gradu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ally
completed as they were filled on the death of successive members
of a family or tribe, the large chambered cairns must be considered as
a separate class from those first described. It is possible that they
may have been designed as the catacombs of a whole tribe; though it
is difficult to reconcile such an idea with the improvident habits of a
rude people, and with the monumental character usually traceable in
these structures. We should rather, perhaps, look upon the chambered
cairn as the memorial of the victors on some bloody battle-field.
On this supposition the Knoc-kill-goill, or hill of the strangers' graves,
would indicate the scene where triumphant invaders had paid the last
honours to their dead ere they bore off with them the spoils of victory.
Such suppositions, however, are altogether apart from the facts
with which we have chiefly to deal. The cromlech, which is now almost
universally recognised as a sepulchral monument,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> formed by
far the most laborious and costly memorial which the veneration or
gratitude of primitive ages dedicated to the honour of their illustrious
dead. It consists of three or four large unhewn columns, supporting
a huge table or block of stone, and forming together a rectangular
chamber, which is frequently further inclosed by smaller
stones built into the intervening spaces. Within this area there is
generally found the skeleton, disposed in a contracted position, and
accompanied with urns and relics of an early period. As the sepulchral
tumulus is justly regarded as only a gigantic grave-mound, so
the origin of the cromlech may be traced to the desire of providing
a cist for the last resting-place of the chief or warrior, equally distinguished
from that which sufficed for common dust&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A little urn&mdash;a little dust inside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once outbalanced the large earth, albeit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day a four-years' child might carry it!"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This class of sepulchral monuments is rare in Scotland when compared
with other monolithic structures that abound in almost every
district of the country. Some few interesting examples, however, are
still found perfect, while partial traces of a greater number remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>to show that the cromlech was familiar to the builders of the Scottish
monolithic era. One of the most celebrated Scottish cromlechs is a
group styled, <span class="smcap">The Auld</span>
<span class="smcap">Wives' Lift</span>, near Craigmadden
Castle, Stirlingshire.
It is remarkable as
an example of a trilith, or
complete cromlech, consisting
only of three stones.
Two of nearly equal length
support the huge capstone,
a block of basalt measuring
fully eighteen feet in length, by eleven in breadth, and seven in depth.
A narrow triangular space remains open between the three stones,
and through this every stranger is required to pass on first visiting
the spot, if, according to the rustic creed, he would escape the
calamity of dying childless. It is not unworthy of being noted, that
though the site of this singular cromlech is at no great elevation, a spectator
standing on it can see across the island from sea to sea; and may
almost at the same moment observe the smoke from a steamer entering
the Frith of Clyde, and from another below Grangemouth, in the Forth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 583px;">
<img src="images/image066.jpg" width="583" height="395" alt="" />
</div>

<p>From the traces of ruined cromlechs which are still visible in various
parts of the country, some of them appear to have been encircled, like
a class of barrows described above, with a ring of standing stones; and
it is exceedingly probable that many of the smaller groups throughout
the country, designated temples, or Druidical circles, belong to the
class of sepulchral memorials. Such is the case with a monolithic
group in the parish of Sandwick, Orkney, and it is still more noticeable
in the ring of Stennis, where the cromlech lies overthrown beside
the gigantic ruins of the circle which once inclosed it. Various other
cromlechs still remain in Orkney. One called the Stones of Vea,
situated on the moor about half a mile south of the manse of Sandwick,
though overthrown, is otherwise uninjured. The capstone
measures five feet ten inches, by four feet nine inches, and still rests
against two of its supporters. A group, which stands on the brow
of Vestrafiold, appears to have included two if not three cromlechs.
There is another remarkable assemblage, in a similarly ruined state,
near Lamlash Bay, in the island of Arran; and a single cromlech stood&mdash;if
it does not still stand&mdash;in the centre of a stone circle in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
island.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> A fine one also remains, in perfect preservation, on the southern
declivity of the hill of Sidla, Forfarshire; another good example has
been preserved on the farm of Ardnadam, in the parish of Dunoon,
Argyleshire; and others, more or less complete, are to be seen at Achnacreebeg,
Ardchattan, and in various districts of the West Highlands,
as well as in other parts of Scotland. Some at least of these gigantic
structures were buried under a tumular mound, precisely in the same
manner as the smaller cists. In 1825 a cromlech was discovered on
the removal of a tumulus of unusual size, situated near the west
coast of the peninsula of Cantyre. It contained only the greatly
decayed remains of a human skeleton, but in the superincumbent soil
were found many bones, and the teeth of the horse and cow, also in
a state of decay. The capstone of this cromlech measured five by
four feet, and its four supporters were each about three feet high.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
A somewhat larger cromlech was disclosed, under nearly similar circumstances,
in the year 1838, on the levelling of a large mound or
tumulus, in the Ph&#339;nix Park, Dublin.</p>

<p>The whole of these examples are constructed of rough and entirely
unhewn blocks. The annexed figure represents a partially
ruined cromlech, at Bonnington Mains, near Ratho, Mid-Lothian, which
is interesting from some traces which it retains of artificial tooling.
Along the centre of the large capstone a series of shallow perforations
have been made at nearly regular intervals, and possibly indicate a
design of splitting it in two. Such is the idea formed by Mr. F. C.
Lukis in a somewhat parallel case, though any indication of artificial
formation in such primitive structures is of the very rarest occurrence.
Mr. Lukis remarks in a communication to the Archæological Association:&mdash;"I
send a sketch of the cromlech on L'Ancresse Common,
Guernsey, on which we have discovered a string of indentations,
probably made with a view to trim the side prop to the required size
of the capstone. These are the first appearances of art in any of the
primeval monuments, and nowhere have we found anything of the
kind excepting on a menhir in the parish of the Forest.... The use of
these indents we can only guess at; but as they follow the fracture of
the stone, (granite,) the early method of breaking stones would be
explained."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Bonnington Mains Cromlech is of large size. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>capstone, which now rests on only two of its supporters, measures
11&frac12; feet in length, and 10&frac12; feet in greatest breadth. It bears the
name of <span class="smcap">The Witch's Stone</span>,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in accordance with the rustic legend
which ascribes its origin to an emissary of the famed old Scottish
wizard, Michael Scot. The term cromlech is probably derived from
<i>cromadh</i> (Gaelic) or <i>cromen</i> (Welsh), signifying a <i>roof</i> or <i>vault</i>, and
<i>clach</i> or <i>lech</i>, a stone. But the compound word is of ancient use
in Scotland. An extensive district in the neighbourhood of Dunblane,
Perthshire, which still bears the name of the Cromlix, is
remarkable for various large transported blocks scattered over its
surface. One of these, which has been supposed to have formed the
capstone of a large cromlech, measures 15&frac12; by 10 feet; but it is
very doubtful if it owes either its form or position to human hands.
According to the proposed derivation the name may be rendered <i>the</i>
<i>suspended stone</i>; and its application to a district covered with transported
rocks from the neighbouring Ochils, of a date long prior to the
historic era, is in no way inconsistent with its more usual application
to the primitive monolithic structures. We have no satisfactory evidence
that these are Celtic monuments. The tendency of our present
researches leads to the conclusion that they are not, but that they
are the work of an elder race, of whose language we have little reason
to believe any relic has survived to our day. On this supposition the
old name of Cromlech is of recent origin compared with the structures
to which it is applied; and of this its derivation affords the
strongest confirmation. It is just such a term as strangers would
adopt, being simply descriptive of the actual appearance of the
monument, but conveying no idea of its true character as a sepulchral
memorial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>Such are the monumental structures belonging to the primitive
periods; but examples of the cist and cinerary urn, deposited without
any superincumbent mound, are of extremely frequent occurrence.
They are most commonly grouped in considerable numbers, indicating
the ordinary rites of sepulture contemporary with the monumental
tumulus or cairn. In the first of these, as in cists found underneath
ancient cairns and tumuli, the body appears to have been generally
interred in a contracted posture, with the knees drawn up to the
breast; and some examples would even seem to indicate that the
limb bones were broken when the body could not otherwise be
disposed within the straitened dimensions which custom prescribed
for the primitive tomb. The custom may be traced to the idea prevalent
long after the Christian era, that it was unworthy of a warrior
to die in his bed. The rude Briton was accordingly interred seated,
and with his weapons of stone or bronze at his side, ready to spring up
when the sound of the war-cry should summon him to renew the strife.
It seems probable that some few cists of full proportions belong to a
period prior to this custom, but it undoubtedly prevailed for ages, and
probably did not disappear till after the introduction of Christianity.
The short stone cist has been discovered of late years in the immediate
vicinity of some of the most ancient Christian churches in the Orkneys,
while examples of a full-sized cist, with the inclosed skeleton extended
at length, are met with under circumstances, and with accompanying
relics, which leave no doubt that they belong to both of the primitive
periods. One singular variation from the custom of burial in the
sitting posture has been noted, in which the body has been interred
with the knees bent, but laid on the right side. It must, however,
be at all times extremely difficult to ascertain the exact position in
which the body has been originally laid, from the little crumbling
heap of decayed bones lying in the contracted cist; and there is no
failing to which antiquarian observers seem at present more liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
than that of seeing too much. An intelligent correspondent writes
from Orkney,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Graves are frequently found in which the skeletons lie in various positions;
in some cases as if the bodies had been huddled into the grave without any care;
in others the knees are considerably bent, and the skeletons lie on the right side.
Several such examples have been discovered in Sandwick; and in a grave which I
recently opened in Westray, the skeleton was found on its right side in a similar
posture. I examined it carefully, and it conveyed the impression to my mind that
the individual had been slain in battle, and the body had been laid in the grave
in the posture it was found on the field of conflict. A similar posture has been
observed in skeletons found in different islands. The rude figure of a Calvary cross
carved on the stone which formed a side of one of the graves in Sanday, seems to
indicate that they were made subsequent to the introduction of Christianity, in the
same way that a mallet-head of gneiss, beautifully polished, found at the right
hand of a skeleton buried in a sitting posture in a grave in Sandwick, denoted a
date prior to that era."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It is possible that the body laid on its right side with
contracted limbs, may be found to indicate the transition-period prior to its interment
at full length. The latter mode of burial appears, in England at least, to
have been restored in Anglo-Saxon times, and before the introduction of Christianity.</p></div>

<p>A very general impression prevails that the primitive cists are invariably
found lying north and south. But this is a hasty conclusion,
which has been the more readily adopted from the distinction it seems
to furnish in contrast to the medieval custom of laying the head towards
the west, that the Christian might look to the point from whence he
expected his Saviour at his second coming. Abundant evidence exists
to disprove the universal use of any particular direction in laying the
cists or interring the dead in the primitive period. A few examples
will suffice to show this. In 1824 a number of cists were discovered
in making a new approach to Blair Drummond House, near the river
Teith, Stirlingshire. They were of the usual character, varying in
size, but none of them large enough to hold a full-grown body laid at
length. Some contained urns of various dimensions, with burnt bones
and ashes, while in others the bones had no appearance of having been
exposed to fire. The urns were extremely rude and simple in form,
and no metallic relics were discovered among them. Here, therefore,
we have a primitive place of sepulture, in a locality already noted for
some remarkable evidences of very remote population. But the cists
lay irregularly in various directions, giving no indication of any chosen
mode or prevailing custom.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In 1814 several cists were discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>in the parish of Borthwick, Mid-Lothian, of the ordinary character
and proportions, and in some cases containing urns, one of which is
now in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.
Others have since been discovered in the same neighbourhood at
various times, but like those on the banks of the Teith, "they were
placed without any regard to order."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In constructing the new road
to Leith, leading from the centre of Bellevue Crescent, Edinburgh, in
1823, several stone cists were found, of the usual circumscribed dimensions
and rude construction of the primitive period, but being disposed
nearly due east and west, were assumed without further evidence
to be "of course since the introduction of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Another
similar relic of the aboriginal occupants of the site of the modern
Scottish capital was found in 1822, in digging the foundation of a
house on the west side of the Royal Circus. In this case the cist lay
north and south, but the head was laid at the south end. The whole
skeleton, with the exception of a few of the teeth, crumbled to dust
on being touched.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In a cist discovered in 1790, under a large cairn
in the parish of Kilbride, the skeleton lay with its head to the east.
Such was its great age, that it also speedily crumbled to dust.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Within the district of Argyleshire, now occupied by the villages of
Dunoon and Kilmun, many primitive cists have been exposed, rudely
constructed of unhewn slabs of the native schistose slate, and some
of them containing lance and arrow-heads of flint, and other equally
characteristic relics, but the irregularity of their disposition proved that
convenience alone dictated the direction in which the bodies were laid.
Other examples of irregular though methodic arrangement of the cists
found in cairns have already been noted, and it would be easy to
multiply similar instances. One more will suffice. In the neighbourhood
of the parish church of Cairnie, Aberdeenshire, various cists have
been exhumed of late years, lying in different and apparently quite
irregular directions. One found in 1836, by a farm-servant while
digging for sand, lay at a depth of about 2&frac12; feet below the surface.
Its interior dimensions were four feet by three feet, and it contained
a human skeleton with the head laid towards the east end. At the
right side was a rude hand-made urn 5&frac34; inches in height, which is
now preserved in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.</p>

<p>It is obvious, from these examples, that the mere direction in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>the body is laid is not in itself conclusive proof either of Pagan or
Christian sepulture. But there does also occur a numerous class of
instances, which seem to indicate that at some early period importance
was attached to the direction in which the body was laid,
and then the cist was placed north and south, or rather north-east
and south-west, with the head towards the north, and designed, it may
be, to look towards the meridian sun. So many instances of this are
familiar to archæologists, that it seems hardly necessary to produce
examples: but two of a peculiar character may be deserving of special
notice. In March 1826, a farmer on the estate of Wormeston,
near Fifeness, in levelling a piece of ground, discovered, at a depth
of ten feet from the surface, thirty cists, disposed in two regular rows,
at equal distances apart, and with the heads towards the north-east.
Their arrangement was peculiar, and obviously the result of some
special design. A line drawn along their ends was nearly due east
and west, and from this they declined obliquely, in the direction of
north-east and south-west. The whole lay parallel, and equidistant
from each other, and in the centre of each of the intervening spaces
an oblong stone was placed so as to abut against the sides of the adjacent
cists.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Another group, disposed nearly similarly to this, was
brought to light on the levelling of a long barrow of unusually large
dimensions, in the parish of Strathblane, Dumbartonshire. Urns
were found within the cists full of earth and burnt bones; and alongside
of each was a column of about three feet in height, selected
from basaltic rocks in the neighbourhood, many of which assume the
form of regular quadrangular crystals. The position of the bodies
appears to have been north and south, as the barrow, which measured
sixty yards in length, lay east and west.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The discovery of any important deviation from the customary rites
of sepulture has already been referred to as probable evidence of some
unwonted change in the social condition of a people; marking, it
may be, the introduction of a new element into the national creed,
or the violent intrusion of some foreign race of conquerors, displacing
older customs by the law of the sword. In the introduction of the
funeral pile and the cinerary urn, we have one important evidence
of the adoption of novel rites. In the systematic disposition of the
body in a fixed direction, it is probable that we may trace another and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>still earlier change. Both practices are deserving of more careful investigation
than they have yet received, in the relation they bear to
the progressive advances of the primitive races of Scotland. Without
the opportunity of comparing more extensive and trustworthy observations
than we yet possess, it would be premature to insist upon the
inferences suggested by them. But it accords with many other indications
that we should find less method or design in the rude sepulchres
of the earliest aborigines, than of those who had long located
themselves in the glades of the old Caledonian forests, and abandoned
nomadic habits for the cares and duties of a pastoral life. The establishment
of such a distinction would furnish a valuable chronological
guide to the archæologist in the arrangement of his materials for primitive
history; meanwhile, it is only suggested for further observation.
The early Christian adapted the position of his grave to the
aspirations of his faith; and a similar practice among older races, in
all probability, bore a kindred relation to some lesson of their Pagan
creed, the nature of which is not yet perhaps utterly beyond recall.
The question of divers races is, at least, one of comparatively easy
solution. On this the investigations of the practical ethnologist may
throw much light, by establishing proofs of distinct craniological
characteristics pertaining to the remains interred north and south,
from those belonging, as I conceive, to a still earlier period,&mdash;before
the rude Caledonian had learned to attach a meaning to the direction
in which he was laid to rest in the arms of death, or to dispose himself
for his long sleep with thoughts which anticipated a future resurrection.</p>

however, more readily secures distinction

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

DWELLINGS.</h3>


<p>Before proceeding to examine in detail the varied contents of the
Scottish tumuli, it may be well to glance at the evidence we possess
of the nature of the habitations reared and occupied by the constructors
of such enduring memorials of their dead as have been described
in the preceding chapter. Scattered over the uncultivated downs
both of England and Scotland, there still remain numerous relics of
the dwellings of our barbarian ancestry, which have escaped the wasting
tooth of centuries, or the more destructive inroads of modern cultivation.
Sir Richard Colt Hoare remarks, in his "Ancient Wiltshire,"&mdash;"We
have undoubted proofs from history, and from existing remains, that
the earlier habitations were pits, or slight excavations in the ground,
covered and protected from the inclemency of the weather by boughs
of trees and sods of turf." Of these primitive pit-dwellings numerous
traces are discernible on Leuchar Moss, in the parish of Skene, and in
other localities of Aberdeenshire; on the banks of Loch Fine, Argyleshire;
in the counties of Inverness and Caithness; and in various other
districts of Scotland still uninvaded by the plough. They are almost
invariably found in groups, affording evidence of the gregarious and
social habits of man in the simplest state of society. The rudest of
them consist simply of shallow excavations in the soil, of a circular or
oblong form, and rarely exceeding seven or eight feet in diameter.
Considerable numbers of these may be observed in several districts both
of Aberdeenshire and Inverness-shire, each surrounded with a raised
rim of earth, in which a slight break generally indicates the door, and
not improbably also the window and chimney of the aboriginal dwel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>ling.
To this class belong the "pond barrow," already referred to as
erroneously ranked among sepulchral constructions. Within a few
miles of Aberdeen are still visible what seem to be the remains of a
large group, or township, of such rude relics of domestic architecture.
These, Professor Stuart suggests, may mark the site of the capital of
the Taixali, when the Roman legions passed the river Dee in the
second century.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> They consist of some hundreds of circular walls
scattered over more than a mile in extent, of two or three feet high,
and from twelve to twenty feet in diameter. Their varying sizes may
be presumed to indicate the gradations of rank which, we know, were
established among the northern Britons, who were undoubtedly, at
the period of the Roman invasion, a race far in advance of the first
constructors of the rude pit-dwelling or "pond barrow" previously referred
to. Nothing, however, has yet been discovered on this site to
indicate any traces of Roman influence. On digging within the area
of the pit-dwellings, a mass of charred wood or ashes, mingled with
fragments of decayed bones and vegetable matter, are generally
found; and their site is frequently discernible on the brown heath, or
the grey slope of the hill-side, from the richer growth and brighter
green of the grass, within the circle sacred of old to the hospitable
rites of our barbarian ancestry, and where the accumulated refuse of
their culinary operations have thus sufficed to enrich the soil.</p>

<p>The first indication of a slight advancement in the constructive
skill of the primitive architect is discernible in the strengthening
of his domestic inclosure with stone. This is not infrequently
accompanied with small circular or oblong field inclosures, as if
indicating the dawn of civilisation, manifested in the protection of
personal property, and the rudiments of a pastoral life, in the folding
of sheep and cattle. Still greater social progress would seem to
be indicated in those examples, also occasionally to be met with in
various districts, where a commanding site appears to have been
chosen for the location; and traces still remain of an earthen rampart
inclosing the whole, as on the Kaimes Hill, in the parish of Ratho,
Mid-Lothian. Such, perhaps, may be the remains of a British camp,
or of a temporary retreat in time of war.</p>

<p>With this class also may be grouped the "Picts' kilns," on which
Chalmers, Train, Sir Walter Scott, and other antiquaries, have expended
much conjecture and useless learning. These are of frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
occurrence in Wigton and Kircudbright shires, as well as in parts
of the neighbouring counties. They consist of elliptical or pear-shaped
inclosures, measuring generally about sixteen feet in length
and seven or eight feet in breadth. Externally the walls appear
to be of earth, sometimes standing nearly three feet high. On removing
the surface they are found to be constructed internally of small
stones, frequently bearing marks of fire. They are popularly believed
to be ancient breweries reared by the Picts for the manufacture of a
mysterious beverage called <i>heather ale</i>. Sir Walter Scott suggests,
with not much greater probability, that they are primitive lime kilns.
They are said by Mr. Train to be invariably constructed on the south
side of a hill, close to the margin of a brook, and with the door
or narrow passage facing the stream. Future excavations on their
sites may perhaps furnish more conclusive evidence of their original
purpose.</p>

<p>Greater art is apparent in the relics of another class of ancient Scottish
dwellings occasionally met with in different parts of the country.
In the Black Moss, already referred to, on the banks of Etive, Argyleshire,
at various points where some advance has been made in recovering
the waste for agricultural purposes, the progress of cultivation has
uncovered rough oval pavings of stone, bearing marks of fire, and
frequently covered with charred ashes. These are generally found to
measure about six feet in greatest diameter, and are sometimes surrounded
with the remains of pointed hazel stakes or posts, the relics,
doubtless, of the upright beams with which the walls of the ancient
fabric was framed. Julius Cæsar describes the dwellings of the
Britons as similar to those of the Gauls;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and these we learn, from
the accounts both of Strabo and Diodorus Siculus, were constructed of
wood, of a circular form, and with lofty tapering roofs of straw. Such
apparently were the structures, the remains of which are now brought
to light within the limits of the Dalriadic possessions. These ancient
Caledonian hearths, now quenched for so many centuries, are discovered
beneath an accumulation of from eight to ten feet of moss,
under which lies a stratum of vegetable mould about a foot deep,
resting upon an alluvial bed of gravel and sand; the original soil upon
which the large sepulchral cairns of the same district have been
reared.</p>

<p>A discovery made at Dalgenross, near Comrie, in 1823, though de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>scribed
in a communication to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland
as an ancient tomb, manifestly furnishes another example of the same
class of primitive dwellings. At Comrie, as in twenty other equally
probable localities, antiquaries of the district have pronounced some
imperfect and half-obliterated earth-works to be the remains of a
Roman camp, and the scene of Agricola's famous victory of Mons
Grampius! The writer, learning that workmen were trenching this
interesting spot, remarks,&mdash;"I hastened to where the men were at
work, and found that they had come upon a circle of flat stones set
on edge, and at the bottom a paving of large flag-stones. The cavity
was filled with a kind of black earth, pieces of charred wood, and also
some fragments of iron, but so completely defaced with rust that it
is impossible to say to what purpose they have been applied." On
pursuing the investigation further, pieces of charcoal and burned
wood were found, along with charred wheat, which might possibly
suggest its having been a granary; but its general characteristics
much more nearly assimilate it to a native dwelling, to which, it
may be, the torch of the Roman legionary applied the brand that
reduced it to a blackened ruin.</p>

<p>Among the relics of primitive domestic architecture brought to
light in later times, no class is more remarkable than the weems, or
subterranean dwellings which have been discovered in different parts
of Scotland. Of this class are two structures discovered under ground
in the parish of Tealing, Forfarshire. One of them consisted of
several apartments formed with large flat stones without any cement;
and in it were found wood-ashes, several fragments of large earthen
vessels, and an ancient stone hand-mill, or querne. The other was a
single vault constructed in the same manner, measuring internally
about four feet both in height and width, and in which were found a
broad earthen vessel, and a stone celt or hatchet.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In another opened
in the parish of Monzie, Perthshire, a stone celt and bronze sword
were found, both of which are preserved at Monzie House. Chalmers
supplies a curious list of similar subterranean dwellings discovered at
various times in Forfar, Perth, Aberdeen, Ross, Sutherland, and Inverness
shires, and in the Orkney Islands.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The like structures are
noted by Martin, among the antiquities of the islands of Walay, Erisca,
and Skye;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and by Pennant also in the latter island. They are de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>scribed
by Martin as "little stone-houses, built under ground, called
<i>earth houses</i>, which served to hide a few people and their goods in
time of war."</p>

<p>The general name applied in Scotland to these subterranean habitations
is Weems, from the Gaelic word <i>uamha</i>, a cave; and as this
name is in use in the low countries, where nearly all traces of the
Celtic dialect have been lost as a living language, probably since the
era of the "Saxon Conquest," it may be accepted as no insignificant
evidence of their Celtic origin or use. In Aberdeenshire, where they
have been found in greater number than in any other single district,
they are more generally known, as in the Hebrides, by the name of
<i>eirde</i> (i.e., <i>earth</i>) <i>houses</i>.</p>

<p>An interesting account of a large group of weems discovered in
Aberdeenshire, is given by Professor Stuart in the Archæologia
Scotica,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and since then many more have been brought to light in
the same district. Several of these opened of late years in Strathdon
are described with great minuteness in the Statistical Account of that
parish.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> On a bleak moor in the adjoining parish, not far from the
old castle of Kildrummie&mdash;which, from many large fossil trees dug
up in it, appears to have once been an extensive forest&mdash;the largest
assemblage of these singular habitations occurs which has yet been
discovered in Scotland. Others have been found about six miles
further up the country, at Glenkindrie, at Buchan, and near the
source of the Don, one of the wildest districts of the Highlands.
They are indeed scarcely less common than the sepulchral cairn.
My object, however, is not so much to accumulate numerous examples,
as to select a few characteristic types of each class of Scottish
antiquities; though these weems appear to possess peculiar claims
to minute description, from their very frequent occurrence. In general,
no external indication affords the slightest clue to their discovery.
To the common observer, the dry level heath or moor under which
they lie presents no appearance of having ever been disturbed by the
hand of man; and he may traverse the waste until every natural
feature has become familiar to his eye, without suspecting that
underneath his very feet lie the dwellings and domestic utensils of
remote antiquity.</p>

<p>The Aberdeenshire weems are constructed of huge masses of
granite, frequently above six feet in length, and though by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>uniform either in internal shape or dimensions, a general style of
construction prevails throughout the whole. Some of them have been
found upwards of thirty feet long, and from eight to nine feet wide.
The walls are made to converge towards the top, and the whole is
roofed in by means of the primitive substitute for the arch which
characterizes the cyclopean structures of infant Greece, and the vast
temples and palaces of Mexico and Yucatan. The huge stones overlap
each other in succession, until the intervening space is sufficiently
reduced to admit of the vault being completed by a single block extending
from side to side. They have not infrequently smaller
chambers attached to them, generally approached by passages not
above three feet in height; and it affords a curious evidence of the
want of efficient tools in the builders of these subterranean structures,
that where these side apartments are only separated from the main
chamber by the thickness of the wall, the stones, though placed flush
with the walls of the latter, project irregularly into the small cells,
giving them a singularly unshapely and ragged appearance. Similar
structures, but of smaller dimensions, have been discovered in Lanarkshire,
at Cartland Craigs, in the neighbourhood of Stonebyres, and at
a place called Cairney Castle. In these last were found quernes,
deers' horns, and bones. In one uncovered in the parish of Auchterhouse,
Forfarshire, a brass ring was discovered; and both there, and
in another in the same parish, were ashes, bones, and quernes.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The
Rev. Thomas Constable furnishes a very interesting description of
one near Lundie House, in the latter county, which was minutely
surveyed by the eminent antiquary, Lord Hailes. Its contents were
of the usual description, including several quernes about fourteen
inches in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> So also, in a minute account of similar structures
in Caithness and Sutherland, furnished to Pennant by the
parish minister of Reay, the writer remarks:&mdash;"We found in them
nothing but hand-mills, or what the Highlanders call quernes, which
were only eighteen inches in diameter, and great heaps of deers' bones
and horns, as they (the Picts) lived much more by hunting than any
other means."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The discovery, indeed, of the primitive hand-mill in
these ancient dwellings is so frequent as to be worthy of special
notice, and might seem to indicate that their original destination
had been for store-houses or granaries, did not the constant occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>rence
of the bones of domestic animals, or of those most prized in the
chase, and frequently in considerable quantities, leave no room for
doubt that they must have been occupied as places of habitation.
They agree very nearly with the description furnished by Tacitus of
the winter dwellings of the Germans, whom he represents as digging
caves in the earth, in which they lay up their grain, and whither
they retire in the winter, or on the advance of an enemy to plunder
the open country.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The entrance to such of these subterranean
dwellings as have been found sufficiently perfect to afford indications
of their original character, appears to have generally been by a
slanting doorway between two long, upright stones, through which
the occupant must have slid into his dark abode. Occasionally a
small aperture has been found at the further end, apparently to give
vent to the fire, the charcoal ashes of which lie extinguished on the
long-deserted floor. In some a passage of considerable length has
formed the vestibule; but so far as now appears, a solitary aperture
served most frequently alike for doorway, chimney, ventilator,
and even window, in so far as any gleam of daylight could penetrate
into the darkened vault. One is forcibly reminded, while
groping in these aboriginal retreats, of Elia's realisations of the
strange social state to which they pertain, in his quaint rhapsody on
Candle-light, "<i>our peculiar and household planet</i>! Wanting it, what
savage unsocial nights must our ancestors have spent, wintering in
caves and unilluminated fastnesses! They must have lain about and
grumbled at one another in the dark. What repartees could have
passed, when you must have felt about for a smile, and handled a
neighbour's cheek to be sure that he understood it! This accounts
for the seriousness of the elder poetry. It has a sombre cast, derived
from the tradition of these un-lanterned nights!" The grave humorist
goes on to picture a supper scene in these unlighted halls, rich
with truthful imaginings, mingled with his curious but thoughtful
jests:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Things that were born, when none but the still night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In truth, these dwellings, constructed with such laborious ingenuity
in every district of Scotland, seem to throw a strange light upon that
dim and remote era to which they belong, giving us some insight into
the domestic habits and social comforts of a period heretofore dark as
their own unillumined vaults.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>Adjoining many of the weems small earthen inclosures are discernible;
some of which are square, measuring about fifteen paces
each way, with the area somewhat below the surrounding soil, and
have probably been constructed for folding sheep or cattle. Others
are circular, and so small as to leave little doubt that there must have
stood the slight huts, constructed of turf and branches of trees, in
which the architect of the cyclopean structure dwelt during the brief
warmth of summer, while he sought refuge from the frosts and snows
of our northern winter in the neighbouring subterranean retreat. The
number of weems frequently found together appears altogether inconsistent
with the idea of their construction as mere places of concealment.
They are manifestly the congregated dwellings of a social
community, though strangely differing from any that have dwelt in
the land within the era of authentic history. When we compare these
dwellings with the clay huts still common in many a Highland district,
or with such humble Lowland biggings as those which have won
a new sacredness as the birthplaces of Hogg or Burns, it is impossible
to overlook the remarkable differences presented by the two
states of society, separated not more widely by time than by variance
of habits and ideas. How striking is the contrast between the artlessness
of the Ayrshire cottage, that sufficed, with its straw roof,
to satisfy the wants of one among the great master-spirits of all
times, and the labour and ingenuity expended in producing these retreats
of the Scottish aborigines. In rudeness of result perhaps both
are on a par. The ingenious and methodic skill, however, entirely
belongs to the old builders. Their mode of constructing with huge
unhewn stones, frequently brought from a considerable distance, seems
to point them out as the architects of that same remote era in which
the rude monumental standing stones and circular groups of monoliths
were reared, which still abound in so many districts of the Scottish
mainland and surrounding isles.</p>

<p>Similar subterranean structures have been discovered at different
times in Orkney, some of them of considerable extent, and including
various recesses and chambers branching off from the chief central
apartment. An unusually minute and interesting account of one in
the parish of Shapinshay is given in the Old Statistical Accounts,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> by
the Rev. Dr. George Barry, the historian of Orkney, in which was
found a beautiful torquated ring, evidently of primitive workmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Structures of the same character, on the mainland of Orkney, were
explored by Lieutenant F. W. L. Thomas, R.N., while engaged in the
Admiralty Survey in 1848. In the course of his investigation of one
of these at Savrock, about a mile to the westward of Kirkwall, and
close to the sea-shore, some curious evidence was disclosed, showing
the primitive arts of its builders, and their inability to overcome an
obstacle requiring unusual skill or effective tools. In excavating the
site for this subterranean dwelling they appear to have cleared away
the soil till they reached the natural rock, which forms the floor of the
vault. Pillars constructed at irregular intervals admit of the whole
being covered by immense slabs resting on them, where the width
is too great to be overarched at so slight an elevation by converging
walls. A long passage leads from this chamber, floored, like it, with
the natural rock. In one place, however, an irregular elevation of
the strata occurs. Such an obstacle was either beyond the skill of
the laborious architects, or at least demanded more exertion than
they cared to expend on its removal; and the roof has accordingly
been elevated so as to admit of free passage by ascending and descending
over the superimposed rock. The passages, as in nearly all the
structures of this class which have been carefully explored, are extremely
straitened. Unfortunately this primitive dwelling supplied
materials for building a neighbouring farm-house and offices before
Lieutenant Thomas had an opportunity of exploring it; so that what
remained was in a very imperfect and dilapidated state. Portions
of the roof still entire, constructed of huge masses of unhewn stone&mdash;one
of them measuring about five feet long&mdash;afforded abundant
evidence that no amount of mere physical labour was grudged in the
completion of the edifice, and seem to justify the probable assignment
of it to a period prior to the introduction of metallic tools. In another
of these subterranean buildings, however, situated on the Holm of
Papey, Lieutenant Thomas observed some doubtful indications of
the use of tools. "On the side wall, near the entrance," he remarks,
"and about six feet from the floor, there is a neatly engraved
circle, about four inches in diameter; there is also another stone,
with the appearance of two small circles touching each other, cut
upon it; but it is so common to find geometrical figures upon the
Orkney flags, arising from a semi-crystallization of the pyrites which
they contain, that I am unable to decide whether these are natural or
not." The height of the passage where it remains perfect is only two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
feet seven inches; but nearly one-half of it is unroofed, and heaps of
large stones lying scattered about afford evidence of the great extent
of the building when complete. Within and around the area of this
ancient structure abundant indications were discovered of its having
been used as a dwelling-place. A large accumulation of wood or
peat-ashes shewed that it must have been occupied for a lengthened
period; and this was further proved by the great quantity of the
bones of domestic animals scattered about the place. Those of
sheep, apparently of the small northern breed still found in Orkney,
were the most numerous; but besides these, there were skulls and
bones of horses and oxen, the skull and portions of the horns of a
deer, and a large bone of a whale. A thick layer of the shells of
the periwinkle, <i>L. Littoralis</i>, covered the building and the adjacent
ground, mixed sparingly with the oyster, the escallop, the common
whelk, and other edible mollusca, which had evidently been consumed
in great quantities on the spot. Along with these were also found
a few extremely rude implements, the relics of the primitive arts of
the builders, besides an antler of a deer artificially severed from the
complete tyne. These objects were roughly fashioned from the thigh-bone
of an ox, and designed apparently as handles for some weapon
or cutting implement, most probably of shell or flint. Other Orkney
relics of the same interesting class, but exhibiting more completeness
of design, and accompanied with attempts at ornament, are described
and figured in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>This large, though very imperfect example of the dwellings of primitive
communities of the ancient population of the Orkneys, may be
properly classed with the weems of the Scottish mainland, though it
is not entirely subterranean. The floor is nine feet below the natural
surface of the ground; and from the mode by which the whole appears
to have been in-roofed with immense overlapping stones, it must have
projected somewhat above the surface, and was probably covered over
with a raised mound of earth. In this respect it approaches, in some
degree, to another class of buildings, which appear to be peculiar to
Orkney and the neighbouring districts of Caithness and Sutherland,
though it is possible enough that they may have been at one time no
less common on the whole Scottish mainland. These structures, for
which it may be convenient to retain the popular name of <i>Picts' houses</i>,
are not strictly speaking, subterranean, but erected generally on the
level ground, or, at furthest, excavated in part out of the side of a hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
so as to admit of a level entrance. Externally they are scarcely distinguishable
from the larger tumuli, but on digging into the green mound
it is found to cover a series of large chambers, built generally with
stones of considerable size, and converging towards the centre, where
an opening appears to have been left for light and ventilation.
These differ very little from many of the subterranean weems, excepting
that they are erected on the natural surface of the soil, and
have been buried by means of an artificial mound heaped over them.
Barry has minutely described one, which he calls an "ancient Pick
house," opened at Quanterness, near Kirkwall.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Another relic of the
same class was explored during the past year by Mr. George Petrie of
Kirkwall, to whose valuable communications on kindred subjects I have
already had occasion to refer. Through his kindness I have been favoured
with a minute account of the result of his labours, as well as with
the plans engraved, drawn from careful measurements taken at the time.</p>

PLAN &amp; SECTIONS OF PICT'S HOUSE, WIDEFORD HILL, ORKNEY, Explored in 1849.<br />

<i>Published by Sutherland &amp; Knox, Edinburgh.</i></a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>In the month of October 1849, Mr. Petrie's attention was directed
to a large tumulus or green knoll, which stands about half-way up
the western declivity of Wideford-hill, overlooking the beautiful bay
of Frith on the mainland of Orkney, and within a short distance of
the Pict's house of Quanterness, described in Barry's History of Orkney.
Being on a steep and unfrequented part of the hill, it appears to have
almost entirely escaped observation. An opening, however, had been
attempted at some former period, but abandoned after an excavation
of about a couple of feet in depth had been effected. Mr. Petrie employed
men to make a section into the mound, and himself superintended
and assisted in the operation, which proved one of considerable
time and labour, from the large stones and the quantity of clay used
in completing the external mound, as well as in the masonry of the
structure found underneath. The building appears to have been constructed
in the following manner:&mdash;A place for the site having been
scooped out of the side of the hill, the cells or apartments were built
of large unhewn stones, the walls being made gradually to converge
as they rose in height, until they approached to within a foot at
top. Externally the work was bounded by a wall of about two feet
high. The entire structure was then brought to a conical shape with
stones and clay; the stones being disposed with considerable regularity,
and over all a thick layer of turf or peat had been laid.
The mound which encloses the whole is about one hundred and forty
feet in greatest circumference, and forty-five feet in diameter. The
work of exploration was commenced by making a cut, six feet in
breadth, upon the north side, and clearing away the stones and clay
in the direction of the highest part of the mound. On penetrating
towards the centre, at about six feet from the top, a stone was exposed
placed on edge, about eighteen inches long and nine inches thick,
underneath which lay another, which was found to cover a hole of
about a foot square, at the top of the chamber marked D in the plan.
(<i>Plate</i> I.) On obtaining entrance to this chamber or cell, it proved,
like those subsequently opened, to be constructed with walls gradually
converging on all sides towards the top, and to measure five feet nine
inches in length from north to south, four feet eight inches in breadth,
and five feet six inches in height. On the west side of the chamber,
the small passage, marked <i>h</i>, was observed appearing to communicate
with another apartment, but it was so blocked up with stones and
rubbish, that excavation had to be resumed from the exterior. After
working for upwards of an hour, the large stone, marked <i>m</i>, was
reached, and on removing it an entrance was effected into the central
chamber A. This was about three-fourths filled with stones and rubbish,
heaped up under the opening marked <i>i</i>, on digging into which
bones and teeth of the horse, cow, sheep, boar, &amp;c., were discovered
mixed with the rubbish, and also some which were supposed to be
those of deer, but not a vestige of human bones.</p>

<p>The general plan will convey the best idea of the form and arrangement
of the chambers. The central apartment, A, is an irregular
oblong vault, ten feet long, five feet in greatest width, and 7&frac12; feet in
height from the bottom to the lower edge of the stones marked o o.
Above this extends the opening i, which had no other covering than
the outer layer of turf. Mr. Petrie came to the conclusion, after a
thorough examination of the whole, that the rubbish found in this
large chamber was the debris of some later building erected above
the mound, the materials of which must have been precipitated
through the narrow opening, as no part of the subterranean structure
was found imperfect with the exception of the passage <i>g</i>. From the
floor of the chamber to the extreme height of the mound is twelve
feet. At the north end of the central chamber the passage <i>e</i> leads to
the cell C, measuring five feet seven inches long, four feet wide, and six
feet high. From the east side of this a passage extends a considerable
way, until it is abruptly terminated by the native rock. The cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ber
D, which was first entered, communicates with the central apartment
by a short passage <i>h</i>, directly opposite to which is the long
gallery <i>b</i>, which formed the entrance to the building from the western
side of the mound. A third passage, <i>a</i>, proceeds in an oblique
direction from the central chamber to a cell B, the proportions of
which are six feet in length, three feet seven inches in width, and
6&frac12; feet in height. Nothing found in this or any of the previously
explored "<i>Picts' houses</i>" gives the slightest countenance to the idea
that they were designed as places of sepulture. The most remarkable
feature about them, however, and the one least compatible with their
use as continuous dwelling-places, is the extremely circumscribed dimensions
of the passages. The whole of them measure about fifteen
inches in height by twenty-two inches in breadth, so that entrance
could only be obtained by crawling on the ground. The arrangement
affords a very striking confirmation of the barbarous state of the
people, who were yet capable of displaying so much skill and ingenuity
in the erection of these cyclopean structures. It is curious indeed
that as civilisation progressed, primitive architecture became not only
simpler but meaner, the ingenious builder learning to supply his
wants by easier methods; while also the gregarious social ties which
such laborious and extensive structures indicate were exchanged for
the more refined separation into families, with, as we may assume,
the gradual development of those virtues and affections which flourish
only around the domestic hearth.</p>

<p>The first step in the descending scale indicative of the abandonment
of the cyclopean architecture for simpler and less durable modes of
construction, appears in a class of dwellings of similar character to
the "<i>Picts' houses</i>," but inferior in their masonry, and generally
smaller in size and less complete in design. Examples of this class
have also been found in various parts of Scotland. They are generally
more entirely subterranean than the "Picts' houses," partaking in
this respect more of the character of the weems. They occupy,
however, an intermediate position, being excavated for the most part
in the side of a hill, so as to admit of an entrance level with the
ground. They are also found more frequently in groups, and have
probably been each the dwelling-place of a single family.</p>

<p>In these, oaken rafters appear to have supplied the place of the
more ancient cyclopean arch, and the walls are generally built of
smaller stones. Weems of this more fragile character have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
discovered at Prieston, near Glammis, in Forfarshire; at Alyth and
Bendochy, Perthshire; and at Pennycuick, Mid-Lothian, as well as in
other districts. One in particular, found at Alvie, Inverness-shire,
measured sixty feet in length. These may be regarded as works
of a later age than the more massive and enduring structures previously
described, when the domestic habits of the old builders had
survived their laborious arts and monolithic taste. One of the most
singular groups of this latter class is a series of contiguous excavations,
on the ridge of a hill immediately to the north of Inchtuthill,
Inverness-shire, known in the district by the name of "the steed's
stalls." Seven circular chambers are cut in the side of a steep bank,
separated by partitions of about twelve feet thick. The floors are
sunk about twenty feet, and each chamber measures fifteen feet in
diameter. A long passage of about four feet wide has formed the
original way of ingress, but the rafters, which most probably formed
the roof, have long since disappeared, and only a very partial estimate
can now be formed of the appearance presented by these singular
chambers when complete.</p>

<p>With the same class also may be reckoned certain structures described
by Pennant as the repositories of the ashes of sacrifices. One
of these, within a few miles of Edinburgh, in the neighbourhood of
Borthwick Castle, was brought to light by the plough coming in
contact with its rough masonry, at a depth of only a foot below the
surface. It may be described as pear-shaped, and with a passage
continuing from the narrow end, measuring fifteen feet in length by
two and a half in breadth. The masonry was of the rudest description,
and nearly the whole space between the walls was filled with
a rich black mould, irregularly interspersed with charcoal, fragments
of bone, and the teeth of sheep and oxen.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> A similar building
was discovered about the same time in the east of Fife, and one
closely corresponding to it has recently been disclosed by railway
operations at Newstead, in the neighbourhood of Melrose. In this, as
in the example above referred to, the narrow passage pointed nearly
north-west; and its masonry was equally rude; but among its contents
were various carved stones, apparently corresponding with
Roman remains frequently found in that neighbourhood, and one in
particular with the cable-pattern, or woollen fillet, so commonly employed
by the Anglo-Roman sculptors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Akin to such subterranean dwellings are the natural and artificial
caves which, in Scotland, as in most other countries, have supplied
hiding-places, retreats for anchorites, and even permanent native
dwellings, and may be described along with this class, though belonging
to many different periods. Such caves abound in Scotland, and
especially along the coast, but in general their interest arises rather
from the associations of popular traditions, than from any intrinsic
peculiarity of character pertaining to them. Few such retreats are
more remarkable, either for constructive art, or historic associations,
than the well-known caves beneath the old tower of Hawthornden,
near Edinburgh. They have been hewn, with great labour and ingenuity,
in the rocky cliff which overhangs the river Esk. No tradition
preserves the history or date of their execution, but concealment was
evidently the chief design of the excavators. The original entrance
is most ingeniously made in the shaft of a very deep draw-well, sunk
in the court-yard of the castle, and from its manifest utility as the
ordinary and indispensable appendage of the fortress, it most effectually
conceals its adaptation as a means of ingress and communication with
the rock chambers beneath. These are of various forms and sizes,
and one in particular is pierced with a series of square recesses, somewhat
resembling the columbaria of a Roman tomb, but assigned by
popular tradition as the library of its later owner, Drummond the
Scottish poet. Whatever was the purpose for which these were thus
laboriously cut, the example is not singular. A large cave in Roxburghshire,
hewn out in the lofty cliff which overhangs the Teviot,
has in its sides similar recesses, and from their supposed resemblance
to the interior of a pigeon-house, the cavern has received the name of
the <i>Doo-cave</i>. Authentic notices of the Hawthornden caves occur
so early as the reign of David II., when a daring band of Scottish
adventurers made good their head-quarters there, while Edward held
the newly fortified castle of Edinburgh, and the whole surrounding
district. In the glen of the little river Ale, which falls into the
Teviot at Ancrum, extensive groups of caves occur, all indicating,
more or less, artificial adaptation, as human dwellings; and in
many other districts similar evidences may be seen of temporary
or permanent habitation, at some remote period, in these rude recesses.
Along the coast of Arran there are several caves of various
dimensions, one of which, at Drumandruin, or Drumidoon, is noted
in the older traditions of the island as the lodging of Fin M'Coul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the Fingal of Ossian, during his residence in Arran. Though low in
the roof, it is sufficiently capacious for a hundred men to sit or lie in
it. In this, as in the previous example, we find evidences of artificial
operations, proving its connexion with races long posterior to those
with whose works we have chiefly to do in this section of archæological
inquiry. In the further end a large detached column of rock
has a two-handed sword engraved on it, surmounted by a deer, and
on the southern side of the cave a lunar figure is cut, similar in character
to those frequently found on the sculptured pillars and crosses
which abound in Scotland. It is now more frequently styled the
king's cave, and described as the retreat of Robert the Bruce, while
he lurked as a fugitive in the Western Isles; but like many other
traditions of the Bruce this seems to be of very recent origin. Other
caves in the same island are also of large dimensions, and variously
associated with popular traditions, as, indeed, is generally the case
wherever subterranean retreats of any considerable extent occur.
Some are the supposed dwellings of old mythic chiefs, whose names
still live in the traditional songs of the Gael. Others are the retreats
which the primitive confessors of Scotland excavated or enlarged for
their oratories or cells. Of the latter class are the caves of St. Molio,
on the little island of Lamlash, or the Holy Isle, on the east coast of
Arran; of St. Columba and St. Cormac, on the Argyleshire coast; of
St. Ninian, in Wigtonshire; of St. Serf, at Dysart, on the Fifeshire
coast; and the celebrated "ocean cave" of St. Rule, in St. Andrew's
Bay. This last oratory consists of two chambers hewn out of the
sandstone cliffs of that exposed coast. The inner apartment is a
plain cell, entered from the supposed oratory of the Greek saint.
The latter is nearly circular, measuring about ten feet in diameter,
and has a stone altar left hewn in the solid rock on its eastern side.
Possibly the singular dwarfie stone of Hoy, in Orkney, owes its origin
to a similar source. A huge mass of square sandstone rock, which
appears to have tumbled from a neighbouring cliff, has been hollowed
out into three apartments, with a fire-place, vent, stone-bed, pillow,
&amp;c. The traditions of the island preserve strange tales of a giant
and his wife who dwelt in this abode, and the "Descriptio Insularum
Orchadium," written by Jo. Ben., (John the Benedictine,) in 1592,
adds to the account of its internal accommodation the following somewhat
whimsical provision for the comfort of the latter,&mdash;"Tempore
camerationis f&#339;mina gravida fuit, ut lectus testatur; nam ea pars lecti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in qua uxor cubuit effigiem habet ventri gravidi." Others of the
Scottish caves and oratories are less artificial in their character.
They are especially abundant in the Western Isles, and on the
neighbouring coast, where the waves of the Atlantic have wrought
out caverns far surpassing in extent and magnificence the largest in
the interior of the country. Few of these, however, possess such
marked features as to distinguish them from similar relics pertaining
to no definite period, which are to be met with on every rocky coast
exposed to the rude buffets of the ocean waves. One exception, indeed,
may well claim to be singled out as unmatched by any other
work of nature or art, though belonging to an older system than the
primeval period of the archæologist. Amid scenery unsurpassed in
the interest of its historic associations, or its venerable relics of medieval
skill, stands the wondrous natural cave which popular tradition
has associated with the favourite name of Fingal.</p>

<p>To those who are curious in investigating such ancient relics, Chalmers

means."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The associations with many of these retreats are of
the most varied and romantic character; and few districts of the
country are without some wild or thrilling legend or historic tradition
relating to such caverned shelters of the patriot, the recluse, or the
persecuted devotee.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

TEMPLES AND MEMORIAL STONES.</h3>


<p>The ideal associations with the future and the past, which seem to
find some outward manifestation even in the rudest state of society,
spring from "that longing after immortality" which affords so
strong an evidence of its truth. To this principle of the human mind
is clearly traceable the origin of the commemorative erections which
abound wherever man has fixed his resting-place. The most primitive
of these ancient memorials are the rude unhewn columns or
<i>standing stones</i>, as they are called, which abound in nearly every district
of Scotland. Occasionally they are found in groups of two or
three, and even in greater numbers, as the celebrated "standing
stones of Lundin," near the Bay of Largo, Fifeshire, the largest of
which measures sixteen feet in height above ground. Three only
now exist, singularly rude and irregular in form, but the stump of a
fourth remained when the account of Largo parish was written in
1792.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It has since been destroyed by treasure-seekers, tempted probably
by the good fortune of others; for in the vicinity have been discovered,
during the present century, some of the most interesting and
valuable antiquities ever found in Scotland.</p>

<p>Of single memorial stones examples might be cited in nearly every
Scottish parish; nor are they wanting even in the Lothians, and in
the immediate vicinity of Edinburgh, where the presence of a busy
population, and the unsparing operations of the agriculturist, have
done so much to obliterate the traces of older generations. But nearly
all are of the same character, differing in nothing but relative size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and the varying outlines of their unhewn masses. They have outlived
the traditions of their rearers, and no inscription preserves to us the
long-forgotten name. We are not left, however, to look upon them
as altogether dumb and meaningless memorials. The history of a
people contemporaneous, it may be, with their builders, reminds us
how even the unsculptured obelisk may keep alive the records committed
to its trust, and prove faithful to those for whom it was designed.
"It came to pass," says Joshua, "when all the people were
clean passed over Jordan, that the Lord spake, saying, Take you
hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests'
feet stood firm, twelve stones, that when your children ask, in time
to come, saying, What mean these stones? then ye shall answer
them." Some of these rude memorials still remaining in the districts
immediately surrounding the Scottish capital, suffice to show the enduring
tenacity of popular tradition. The <i>Hare Stane</i> on the
Borough Moor of Edinburgh, celebrated in the lay of Marmion as
the support of Scotland's royal banner,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"The massive stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which still in memory is shown,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>affords one example of this. Mr. William Hamper, an ingenious
English antiquary, has elaborately elucidated the derivation of the
name as applied in England, and the use of the <span class="smcap">HOAR STONES</span>,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the
<i>menhars</i>, or bound stones, as stones of memorial, like "the stone of
Bohan, the son of Reuben," and other ancient landmarks of Bible
story.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Probably we shall justly esteem the "Hare Stane" as the
memorial of the western boundary of the ancient chase, claimed from
time immemorial by the neighbouring capital; but if so, its name
has long survived all popular recollection of the meaning which it
bore. The same term, <i>hair stanes</i>, is applied to a circular group of
stones near Kirkdean, in the parish of Kirkurd, Peeblesshire. It
would appear, however, to have been more frequently used in Scotland
in the most sacred sense of a memorial, if we judge from the
examples of its application as the designation of cairns, some of
which, at least, and probably all, are sepulchral monuments. Among
these are the Haer Cairns in the parish of Clunie; the Haer Cairns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>of Blairgowrie and Kinloch, Perthshire; the Hier Cairns of Monikie,
Forfarshire; the Herlaw, a gigantic cairn in the parish of East Kilbride,
Lanarkshire; the more celebrated Harlaw of Aberdeenshire;
the Harelaw at Lochhore, Fifeshire, and another in the same county,
near Burntisland, where were found underneath the cairn a cist containing
a skeleton with a bronze spear-head lying beside it.</p>

<p>Not far from the Hare Stone on the Borough Moor of Edinburgh,
formerly stood another monolith termed the Camus Stone, but which,
though it gave name to a neighbouring estate, and formed the march
stone of its eastern bounds, was barbarously destroyed within memory
of the present generation, to furnish materials for repairing the road!
This name, whatever be its true derivation, is attached to numerous
Scottish localities. Both in the example here referred to, in the
Camus Stone of Kintore, Aberdeenshire, and in that near the village
of Camustown, Forfarshire, vague tradition associated the stones with
the name of a supposed Danish chief; but this is more probably the
invention of modern topographers, than a genuine heirloom of popular
tradition. The name of Combust figures among the list of Pictish
kings as a contemporary of Marcus Antoninus Philosophus,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> but the
authority, though older, is not much more trustworthy; and we shall
perhaps seek the meaning of the term more correctly in the correspondence
of local peculiarities, as in Cambusbarron, Cambuslang,
Cambusnethan, &amp;c., where it is understood to indicate a promontory
or bank inclosed by a crooked stream, from the Celtic, cam, crooked.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
These Cambus-stones have all probably served as landmarks, or hoar
stones; though answering also, it may be presumed, at times, like
Laban and Jacob's Pillar, as the memorial of some high contract between
friendly or rival chiefs.</p>

<p>Other stones, however, are associated with a variety of historical
and legendary traditions, as the "Witch Stane" near Cairnbeddie,
Perthshire, where, according to ancient local belief, Macbeth met by
night with two celebrated witches to advise on the fate of his kingdom.
It is fully as probable that this tradition may have existed in
Shakspeare's time, as that it is derived from the marvellous conception
of his great tragedy. When Cairnbeddie Mound was opened
partially, about thirty years since, a quantity of very small iron horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>shoes, with fragments of swords, and other weapons of the same
metal, were found; so that it, doubtless, forms the tumulus on the
site of some old and hard-fought battle-field, in which, perchance,
the great usurper may have played his part. Another stone in the
neighbouring parish of Meigle, a huge mass of unhewn trap, bears the
name of "Macbeth's Stane," and various local traditions with which
his name is associated, add to the probability of some true foundation
for popular belief.</p>

<p>Evidence of the use of such rude columns as landmarks is frequently
found of a comparatively recent date. The mention of
standing stones, or circles, is not uncommon in charters and other
deeds relative to the holding of courts and the boundaries of lands.
More than one curious example of this occurs in the Registrum Episcopatus
Aberdonensis, as in the following, which also suffices to show
the ancient application of the term standing stones:&mdash;"Thir are the
boundis own my lord of Athollis syde, the stannande staine merkit
like a horse-sho, and the dik passande fra the samme staine to the
burg, and syne be zound the stripe beweste the smedy of Balmany."
The <i>Saxum Falconis</i>, or "Hawk Stane," at St. Madoes, Perthshire,
which stands on the marches of what is known to have been the
ancient possessions of the Hays of Errol, and still bounds the parishes
of St. Madoes and Inchture, is referred to by Boece as existing in his
day, (1500,) and as having been set up immediately after the defeat
of the Danes in the Battle of Luncarthy, fought <i>circa</i> <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 990. The
victory is ascribed, according to a well-known tradition&mdash;still commemorated
in the armorial bearings of the Hays&mdash;to the timely interference
of a Scottish peasant and his two sons:&mdash;"Sone efter ane
counsal was set at Scone, in the quhilk Hay and his sonnis war maid
nobil, and dotad, for thair singular virtew provin in this feild, with
sindry landis to sustene thair estait. It is said that he askit fra the
King certane landis liand betwix Tay and Arole; and gat als mekil
thairof as ane falcon flew of ane mannis hand, or scho lichtit. The
falcon flew to ane toun four milis fra Dunde, called Rosse, and lichtit
on ane stane, quhilk is yit callit The Falcon Stane; and sa he gat
al the landis betwix Tay and Arole, six milis of lenth, and four of
breid; quhilk landis ar yit inhabit be his posterite."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The sacredness which naturally attached to landmarks, in early
times, and of which we have remarkable evidence in the Old Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
references to them, was doubtless no less strongly felt in relation
to all stones of memorial, the enduring parchments of an unlettered
age. They seem accordingly to have been sometimes regarded, like
the medieval altar, as the inviolable witness of any agreement. The
following curious evidence of this feeling occurs in a deed in the possession
of W. H. Fotheringham, Esq., dated at Kirkwall in 1438:&mdash;"Till
all and synd lele folk in Cryste, to quhais knawledge yir pnt.
wris. sal cum, Henry Randall, lawman of Orknay, John Naraldson,
balze off Kirkwaw, Jamis off Lask, Greeting in Gode ... make kend
that we the forsaide bystude saw and onherde, and for witnesse wes
tane quhene y<sup>t</sup> John off Erwyne and Will. Bernardson swor on the
Hirdmane Stein before owre Lorde y<sup>e</sup> Erle off Orknay and the
gentiless off the cuntre, that thay bystude saw and onherde, and
for witnesse wes tane quhene that Tho<sup>s.</sup> Sincler, y<sup>e</sup> son off quhiln
Davy Syncler, callit in y<sup>e</sup> vestre in Sant Mawing Kirk, John of
Kirkness," &amp;c. In this comparatively recent transaction we have probably
a very accurate illustration of the ceremonial which accompanied
the erection of a hoare-stone, or stone of memorial, whether
as a landmark or the evidence of some solemn treaty. The document
from which it is extracted has a further interest in connexion with
early Scottish history. Its date is thirty years prior to the marriage
of James III. of Scotland with Margaret of Denmark, when Orkney
was first annexed to the Scottish Crown; yet it is written throughout
in the Scottish tongue.</p>

<p>Of an entirely opposite character are the Cat Stanes found in various
parts of Scotland, apparently deriving their name from the British
<i>Cad</i> or the Celtic <i>Cath</i>, signifying a battle, and therefore marking
the scene of some ancient conflict. In the immediate neighbourhood
of the Camus Stone near Edinburgh, formerly stood two very large
conical cairns, styled the Cat-stanes, until demolished by the same
irreverent utilitarians who had found covetable materials in the
rude memorial stone. Underneath the cairns were cists containing
human skeletons and various bronze and iron weapons. Two iron
spear-heads found in them are now preserved in the neighbouring
mansion of Mortonhall; and according to the description of other
relics formerly possessed by a neighbouring farmer, they would appear
to have also contained celts and other weapons of bronze. A few
yards to the north-west of the site which these cairns occupied, there
still stands the Kel or Caiy Stone, a mass of the red sandstone of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
district, measuring above eleven feet in height. On digging in the
neighbourhood of this primitive monument a quantity of human
bones have been found, irregularly interred, without cists or urns, and
not far from it are still visible the rude earth-works of a British
camp. Much more extensive intrenchments of an oval form existed
in the immediate neighbourhood, prior to the construction of the
new road, and are described by General Roy in tracing one of the
Roman iters.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> There is another
standing-stone within the Mortonhall
grounds, at about half a mile distant
from the site of the Cat-stanes,
and also two larger masses lying together,
which are not improbably the
remains of a ruined cromlech. Here,
in all likelihood, has been the battle
ground of ancient Scottish chiefs, contending,
it may be, with some fierce
invader. The locality is peculiarly
suited for the purpose. It is within
a few miles of the sea, and though inclosed
in an amphitheatre of hills, it
is the highest ground in the immediate
neighbourhood, and the very spot on which a retreating host
might be expected to make a stand ere they finally betook themselves
to the neighbouring fastnesses of the Pentland Hills. A few
miles to the westward of this is the oft-noted <span class="smcap">Catt Stane</span>, in Kirkliston
parish, on which the painful antiquary may yet decipher the
imperfect and rudely lettered inscription&mdash;the work most probably of
much younger hands than those that reared the mass of dark whinstone
on which it is cut&mdash;<span class="smcap">IN [H]OC TVMVLO IACET VETTA .. VICTR ..</span> About
sixty yards to the west of the Cat-stone a large tumulus formerly
stood, which was opened in 1824, and found to contain several complete
skeletons, but nearly all traces of it have now disappeared.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Caiy Stone</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rearing of stones of memorial on the scenes of victory is a
custom of many early nations, and one which has not even now entirely
fallen into disuse. The Bauta-stein of Norway and Denmark
corresponds in its signification with the Cat-stane of Scotland, nor
are there wanting examples of Scottish monoliths surrounded like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the Danish ones with a pile of small stones at their base. Such is
the case with the <span class="smcap">Clach Stein</span> at Bible in Lewis, and the remarkable
<span class="smcap">Clach an Druidean</span>, or Stone of the Druids, in the same island, which
stands above sixteen feet high.</p>

<p>"The Gaelic people," says Chalmers,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> "did sometimes erect memorial
stones; which as they were always without inscription, might
as well have not been set up." But independently of the fact that
these monuments of the remote past have long since accomplished the
original purpose of their erection, it is obvious that some of them can
still furnish an intelligible response to those who ask, "What mean
these stones?" Many of them, however, it is true, have waxed dumb
in the lapse of ages, and hold a more mysterious silence than that
which surrounded the long-guarded secrets of Egypt's memorial
stones. Some of these are perhaps the last solitary column which
marks the site where once the "Druid circle" and its mystic avenue
covered the plain. Remote and widely severed stones may thus be
parts of the same systematic design, as is rendered sufficiently probable
when we remember that that of Avebury numbered even in the
days of Stukeley six hundred and fifty stones, though then by no
means perfect, and that that of Carnac in Brittany extends over an
area of eight miles in length. So common are they still in Scotland
that Chalmers dispenses with his usual laborious accumulation of
references, and contents himself with this very comprehensive one:
"See the Statistical Accounts <i>everywhere</i>!"</p>

<p>Other monoliths are probably the <span class="smcap">Tanist Stones</span>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> where the new
chief or king was elected, and sworn to protect and lead his people.
One at least, the most famous of Scottish Tanist Stones, still exists,
and mingles with the gorgeous rites of coronation services in Westminster
Abbey the primitive elements of our most ancient popular
elective monarchy. The celebrated <i>Lia Fail</i>, or Stone of Destiny, is
that which, according to Scottish chroniclers, Gathelus, the Spanish
King, a contemporary of Romulus, sent with his son when he invaded
Ireland; and on equally trustworthy authority it is affirmed to have
been the veritable pillow of the patriarch Jacob, which he set up as a
memorial stone, on the scene of his wondrous vision!</p>

<p>The Lia Fail is believed to have served for many ages as the coronation
throne of the monarchs of Ireland; and according to Irish
bardic traditions, to have borne testimony to the divine right of sovereignty
by roaring beneath the legitimate monarch when seated on it
at his inauguration! It was removed to Scotland, and deposited at
Icolmkil or Iona, for the coronation of Fergus Erc, or Mac Eark, a
prince of the blood royal of Ireland;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> from which it was finally translated
to the Abbey of Scone, when the Scottic kings had extended
their sovereignty over the ancient kingdom of the Picts. In Scotland
it bore the name of the "King's Stone," and was regarded as the
national palladium, until Edward I. in 1296, ordered it to be conveyed
to Westminster as an evidence of his absolute conquest of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
But the evidence failed, and the older prophecy holds good
that wherever that stone rests princes of Scottish blood shall rule
the land, though the Lia Fail no longer gives audible testimony
to the legitimate heir. It can hardly fail to impress the thoughtful
mind, as a singular link between eras so widely severed, not by time
only but by every social and political change, that the rude Tanist
Stone belonging to a period dimly cognizable in the remotest past,
still forms a part of the coronation chair of the British sovereign in
Westminster Abbey. The use of the Tanist Stone is, like so many
other primitive customs, of Eastern origin, and traceable to a very
remote era. Thus when Abimelech was made king, it was <i>by the pillar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>which was in Shechem</i>;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and when Jehoash was anointed king by
Jehoiada, <i>the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The standing
stone appears indeed to have been the most sacred attestation of
every solemn covenant between contracting parties, including that
between the elected chief or king and his people; and hence the
super-addition of those peculiar virtues supposed to attach to the
ancient Scottic Lia Fail.</p>

<p>One other stone is deserving of some note, from the vague records
which tradition has preserved of its connexion with the rites of a
long extinct creed. Mr. Wakeman remarks, in his Archæologia
Hibernica,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> "Perforated stones, very similar to the ordinary pillar
stone, are found in many parts of Ireland, Scotland, and even, as
appears from Mr. Wilford's Asiatic Researches, in India. Abroad as
well as at home their origin is shrouded in the deepest obscurity, nor
is it likely that the subject can ever be elucidated." They are by no
means so common, however, as this would imply. At Applecross, in
the west of Ross-shire, a perforated stone occupies the centre of a
stone circle; and at Tormore, in the parish of Kilmorie, Buteshire,
there is a celebrated monolithic circle, styled <i>Siudhe choir Fhionn</i>, or
Fingal's cauldron seat, one of the columns of which is perforated, and
is commemorated in old Highland traditions as the stone to which
the Celtic hero was wont to tie his dog Bran. Immediately adjoining
the circle are three huge unhewn columns, about fifteen feet in height
above the surface of the moor. Along with these examples may be
noted a curious group in the parish of Maddern, Cornwall, consisting
of three stones, the centre one of which is pierced with a large circular
hole, through which, Borlase informs us,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> rheumatic patients
were wont to crawl as a sovereign remedy for their disease. Perforated
stones must once have been common in England, and probably
in Scotland also, as the Anglo-Saxon laws repeatedly denounce similar
superstitious practices; but they are now of the rarest occurrence.
Tradition has preserved some curious associations with one of the
most interesting Scottish examples, which may perhaps be thought
to throw some doubtful light on the use to which such perforated
pillars were devoted at a comparatively late period of our island
history. The celebrated <span class="smcap">Stone of Odin</span>, near the Loch of Stennis,
in Orkney, which has had a new interest added to it by being inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>woven
with the romantic incidents of the "Pirate," was one of the
remarkable monolithic group called The Stones of Stennis. It formed
no part, however, either of the Great Ring of Brogar, or of the
neighbouring circle of Stennis, but stood apart, to the north-east of
the latter group; though it can scarcely be doubted that it bore
some important relation to these ancient and mysterious structures.
The Stone of Odin is described as standing about eight feet high,
and perforated with an oval hole large enough to admit a man's
head. A curious, though rudely executed bird's-eye view of the
Stones of Stennis is given in the Archæologia Scotica,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> from a drawing
executed by the Rev. Dr. Henry, about the year 1780, and there a
man and woman are seen interchanging vows, plighted by the promise
of Odin, which Sir Walter Scott refers to as "the most sacred of
northern rites yet practised among us." The vow was sworn while
the engaging parties joined hands through the perforation in the stone;
and though it is difficult to decide how much of the tradition may be
ascribable to modern embellishment and the adaptation of a genuine
heirloom of primitive superstition to the preconceived theories of local
antiquaries, there cannot be a doubt of the popular sacredness attached
to this sacramental stone in former times. An illustration of the practice
from which this originated is supposed to be traceable in an ancient
Norse custom, described in the Eyrbiggia Saga, by which, when an
oath was imposed, he by whom it was pledged passed his hand, while
pronouncing it, through a massive silver ring sacred to this ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The solemnity attached to a vow ratified by so awful a pledge as
this appeal to the Father of the Slain, the severe and terrible Odin,
continued to maintain its influence on the mind till a comparatively
recent date. Dr. Henry, writing in 1784, refers to the custom as
having fallen into disuse within twenty or thirty years of the time
he wrote, and adds, "this ceremony was held so very sacred in those
times, that the person who dared to break the engagement was
counted infamous, and excluded all society." Principal Gordon, of
the Scots College, Paris, who visited Orkney in 1781, thus refers to a
curious example, showing probably the latest traces of this venerable
traditionary relic of Scandinavian superstition:<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At some distance from the semicircle stands a stone by itself, eight feet high,
three broad, nine inches thick, with a round hole on the side next the lake. The
original design of this hole was unknown, till about twenty years ago it was discovered
by the following circumstance: A young man had seduced a girl under
promise of marriage, and she proving with child, was deserted by him. The young
man was called before the Session; the elders were particularly severe. Being
asked by the minister the cause of so much rigour, they answered, You do not
know what a bad man this is; he has broke the promise of Odin. Being further
asked what they meant by the promise of Odin, they put him in mind of the stone
at Stenhouse, with the round hole in it, and added, that it was customary when
promises were made, for the contracting parties to join hands through this hole;
and promises so made were called the promises of Odin."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p></div>

<p>It is possible that the awe which the vow of Odin so recently inspired
may have originated in the use of the stone for more dreadful
purposes than the most solemn contract, sealed with imprecations
derived from a barbarous Pagan creed; though little value can be
attached to another tradition, described by Dr. Henry as still existing
in his time,&mdash;that human victims destined for sacrifice were
bound to the perforated column, preparatory to their slaughter as an
acceptable offering to the terrible god. Another stone, on the north
side of the island of Shapinshay, bears the name of the Black Stone
of Odin; but no definite associations are now attached to it, and
its sole value is as the march stone between the grounds of two conterminous
heritors.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> A more trustworthy tradition ascribed peculiar
virtues to the Stennis Stone, manifestly corresponding with those referred
to by Borlase in connexion with one at Maddern, and denounced
in ancient Anglo-Saxon laws. According to this a child
passed through the hole would never shake with palsy in old age.
The practice exhibits a sagacious anticipation of future ills, the hole
being too small to admit of the remedy being made available when
most required.</p>

<p>A view of this remarkable memorial of ancient manners and superstitious
rites, is given in Lady Stafford's "Views in Orkney, and on
the North-eastern Coast of Scotland," drawn in 1805, and has been
copied as one of the illustrations for the Abbotsford edition of the
Pirate. But the stone itself no longer exists. After having survived
the waste of centuries, until it had nearly outlived the last
traditionary remembrance of the strange rites with which it had once
been associated, it was barbarously destroyed by a neighbouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>farmer, in the year 1814, along with two stones of the adjacent semicircle.
Had it not been for the interference of Mr. Malcolm Laing,
the historian, the whole group of Stennis would have been broken
down as building materials for the ignorant Goth's cow-sheds. The
act was the less culpable, perhaps, as the perpetrator was a stranger
who had only recently taken up his abode in Orkney. It affords
proof, however, that the native reverence for the venerable memorial
had not entirely disappeared, that its unfortunate destroyer's life was
rendered miserable by the petty persecutions with which the natives
sought to revenge the destruction of their sacramental stone. So
far, indeed, was this manifestation of popular indignation carried,
that various conspiracies are said to have been formed to injure him,
and two different attempts were made to set fire to his dwelling
and property;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> a sufficiently manifest token that the old spirit of
veneration for the stone of Odin was not unknown to the modern
Orcadian.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable class of monumental stones remain to be
described, including the singular sculptured pillars, peculiar, it is
believed, to Scotland. But we have already trespassed on the relics
of later eras, and these necessarily belong to a period long posterior
to that when the rude aboriginal Caledonian possessed no other tools
than the stone hammer and the flint chisel or arrow-head, with which
to grave the memorial of his fame and the annals of his race.</p>

<p>In the investigations of the archæologist, even though devoted, as
this inquiry is, to the examination of ancient memorials within an
extremely circumscribed area, he frequently finds that he is dealing
with the evidences of certain phases of progressive civilisation in the
history of the race, rather than with mere national peculiarities.
The farther research is pursued this becomes the more apparent, and
we learn, without much surprise, from the recent invaluable researches
in the valley of the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> that the ancient tumuli of the American
continent are found to contain, amid many relics peculiar to the new
world, stone celts and hammers, flint and bone arrow and lance heads,
and other primitive weapons and implements so precisely resembling
those disinterred from the early British barrows, that the most experienced
eye could hardly tell the one from the other. To conclude
from this that we have found evidence of an affinity of race, or of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>mutual intercourse between the rude aborigines of Britain and America
in that mysterious period of the long forgotten past, however plausible
it might seem at first sight, would be to adopt a theory which the
investigation of the arts of modern races, such as the natives of
Polynesia, must at once dispel. The same correspondence of primitive
weapons is found in the north of Europe, in the steppes of
Asia, in the ancient tumuli near the Black Sea, and even mingling
with the evidences of earliest civilisation on the banks of the Tigris
and the Nile. We must look, therefore, for the means of accounting
for such remarkable correspondence of primitive tools, to some cause
operating naturally at a certain stage of development in the human
mind. It is the first manifestation of man's intelligent instincts as a
tool-using animal, and furnishes a singular evidence of the instinctive
faculties which belong to him as well as to the lower animals, though
few and uncertain traces of these remain distinguishable where civilisation
has fostered the nobler faculty of reason, and brought it into
healthy and vigorous play.</p>

<p>It is not unworthy of note, in the exhibition of a more advanced
stage of the same development of features pertaining to the human
mind in its progressive civilisation, that there seems also to have
been an epoch in the early history of man, when what may be
styled the monolithic era of art has been developed under the utmost
variety of circumstances. In Egypt it was carried out, with peculiar
refinement, by a people whose knowledge of sculpture and the decorative
arts proves that it had its origin in a far deeper source than the
mere barbarous love of vast and imposing masses. In Assyria, India,
Persia, and throughout the Asiatic continent, this monolithic taste
appears to have manifested itself among many independent and
widely severed races. In Mexico and the central portions of the
American continent, a people parted apparently by impassable oceans
from the old world, have left enduring evidences of this psychological
phenomenon; and in the north of Europe, under circumstances no less
widely different from all these nations, numerous monolithic columns
and groups attest the same pervading idea. In our own island, more
especially, where now we are content to build a monumental obelisk,
just as we do a cotton-mill chimney, with successive tiers of stone, we
possess some of the most remarkable remains of this peculiar class.
The destructive encroachments of civilisation, and the ruthless assaults
of the quarrier and the builder, have done much to obliterate these sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>gularly
interesting memorials of primitive antiquity. Already the vast
temple of Avebury has all but disappeared, like an old ripple-mark
of the tide of time. But there still remain, in the huge cromlechs,
circles, and standing stones scattered throughout the land, abundant
evidence of the influence of the same peculiar taste on the early races
of the British Isles, originating, as I conceive, in an unconscious aim
at the expression of abstract power.</p>

<p>The convenient terms of Druid altars and temples have long supplied
a ready resource for the absence of all knowledge of their origin
or use. The cromlech has at length been restored to its true character
as a sepulchral monument by the very simple process of substituting
investigation for theory. But after the devotion of many learned and
ponderous volumes to the attempted elucidation of Druidism, the subject
has lost little of its original obscurity; and we shall follow a safer,
if it be a less definite guide, in tracing the peculiar character of the so-called
Druidical monuments to feelings which appear to have exercised
so general an influence on the human race. The idea of the
origin of these monolithic structures from some common source seems
to have suggested itself to many minds. Colonel Howard Vyse, when
describing the great hypæthral court, surrounded with colossal figures,
which stands before the rock temple of Gerf Hossein, the ancient
Tutzis, remarks:&mdash;"The massive architraves placed upon the top
of these figures reminded me, like those at Sabooa, of Stonehenge;
and it is not improbable that, together with religious traditions,
the art of building temples may have even reached that place from
Egypt."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>To speak, as some recent writers have done, as if the mechanical and
engineering knowledge by which the Egyptians were able to quarry
and erect their gigantic monoliths had become even a greater mystery
to us than the hieroglyphic legends which they inscribed on them, is
manifestly a hasty and altogether unfounded assumption. It is their
taste, and not their skill, which is wanting. The modern eye is satisfied
with the perfect proportions of the monumental column, without
seeking the barbaric evidence of difficulties overcome implied in the
lifting of it in one mass upon its pedestal. A few years since the
workmen in Craigleith quarry, near Edinburgh, disengaged a mass of
the fine sandstone of the district, capable of rivalling the colossal
obelisks of Egypt; but the proprietor in vain advertised the feat, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the hope that some committee of taste would avail itself of the opportunity
of once more erecting a British monolith of primitive mass;
and he had at last to break it down into cubes adapted to the ordinary
wants of the modern builder. When, however, such a feat has
to be accomplished as the spanning of the Menai Straits with a railway
viaduct, no lack of engineering skill is felt in coping with difficulties
which may stand comparison with the most gigantic of the
self-imposed feats of the old Egyptian builder.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> We may fairly presume,
therefore, that we have left the monolithic era behind us, not
by the oblivion of former knowledge, but by the progress of the human
mind beyond that stage of development when it finds its highest
gratification in such displays of rude magnificence and vast physical
power.</p>

<p>The Stones of Stennis, already referred to as the Orcadian Stonehenge,
are unquestionably the most remarkable monolithic group in
Scotland, and, indeed, if we except the great temple of Salisbury
Plain, in the British Isles. Without entering meanwhile into any
investigation of the evidence which various writers have derived from
northern mythology or popular traditions, with a view to throw some
light on the probable date of their origin, or the character of their
builders, it furnishes a rational basis for the classification of such
ancient monuments among the remains of the Primeval Period, that
they exhibit no indication of having been hewn or shapen with tools.
Unless the perforation of the stone of Odin be an exception, the
columns have been erected just as they were dislodged from the earth;
and we have only to account for their separation from the parent strata
and their erection on the site which they still occupy. In this respect
they correspond with the more ancient English temple of Avebury
rather than with that of Stonehenge, which belongs to an era when
efficient metallic tools, whether of bronze or iron, must have supplied
the means of hewing the gigantic columns into some degree of uniformity,
and fitting the lintels to the upright columns by means of
the mortice and tennon still discoverable amid the ruins of that
wonderful monument of ancient skill. We are not altogether without
some evidence to induce the belief that the early Caledonian did dislodge
and cleave into amorphous columns the unquarried rocks with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
which his native soil abounded, when armed with no fitter tool than
the stone wedge and hammer. The Rev. James Little, in furnishing
Sir John Sinclair with an account of the antiquities of the parish of
Southwick, in Kirkcudbright, mentions the discovery, on the estate
of Southwick, "in the middle of a large granite stone, when blasted
with gunpowder, in a socket exactly fitted to it, of a piece of the same
kind of substance, smooth and polished, in form somewhat resembling
a rude hatchet, about nine inches long. The virtuosi to whose inspection
it was submitted did not hesitate immediately to pronounce
it to be a hatchet which had been used by the Druids in performing
sacrifices; which conjecture they imagined warranted by the vestiges
of a Druidical temple very near where it was found."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The reverend
Statist rather inclines to regard it as a <i>lusus naturæ</i>. A few years
later another was found, under similar circumstances, in a cavity of
an enormous mass of stone, on the farm of Mains, near Dumfries. It
was also of polished granite; and from the outline of it in the Archæologia,
no doubt can be entertained of its being a genuine stone wedge
or celt.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Still it is not meant to assume from this that all such
monuments were erected prior to the introduction of metals, but only
that they indicate an origin coeval with the state of civilisation in
which the use of metallic implements was, at best, but imperfectly
known, and when the massive size of these rude unhewn monoliths
abundantly satisfied the human mind in its desire for a visible shrine
adequate to the awful mysteries shadowed forth in the heathen mythology.</p>

<p>The site of the celebrated Orkney group is perhaps little less remarkable
than the venerable monuments to which it owes its name.
A long and narrow neck of land separates the Loch of Stennis, a salt-water
lake into which the tide rises and falls, from the fresh waters
of the Loch of Harray, save at the narrow strait of Brogar, where at
times the tidal wave mingles with the tideless waters of Harray; and
on this, the great circle or Ring of Brogar, as it is most commonly
styled, is reared. Judging from the regularity with which such of the
stones as still remain are disposed, the number of columns originally
forming the circle appears to have been sixty, on the assumption that
they were placed at nearly equal distances apart. Of these sixteen
remained <i>in situ</i> in 1792, and eight lay prostrate near their original
sites; but now only twenty-three stones remain, ten of which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>prostrate, and the broken stumps of a few more serve to indicate
the places they once occupied. The whole is inclosed by a deep
trench, except at two opposite points, where a level break occurs,
affording the means of entrance and exit. The diameter of the great
circle, from the inner edge of the trench, measures 366 feet. From
the eastern entrance it is possible that an avenue of stones may have
once led to the Bridge of Brogar, as the stepping-stones are styled by
which the shallow channel between the Lochs of Harray and Stennis
is crossed. On the eastern side of the channel one column still remains,
bearing the name of the Watch Stone; derived apparently
from its position on the brink of the ford commanding the passage
between the great circle and the opposite shore, but which may possibly
be the only relic of the avenue once connecting the circles on each
side of the loch. The smaller group is now frequently designated, from
its crescent form, the temple of the moon, and the larger circle that
of the sun; but there can be no doubt that these are quite modern
and spurious designations. Stennis Circle, as the smaller group is
properly termed, is situated on a nearly level piece of ground, and its
semicircular outline is further indicated by an inclosing mound of
earth, presenting its opening to the south; whereas the larger circle
is environed only by a fosse. This group was composed, at no very
remote period, of seven or eight stones, but no doubt can be entertained
that the figure was originally a circle, inclosing with its vallum,
a large cromlech, the ruins of which still remain within the area.
It is described by Wallace in 1700 as "a round set about with high
smooth stones or flags;"<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> so that it would appear to have been complete
at that comparatively recent period. It stood upon a raised
circular platform, part of which still remains about three feet above
the surrounding level. Beyond this is the embankment, forming
a circle, the radius of which, measured from its outer edge, is 117
feet. The radius of the circle, on the circumference of which the stone
columns were placed, is about fifty-two feet; and judging from the space
between those still standing, twelve stones may be supposed to have
completed the circle. But though so small a group when compared
with the Ring of Brogar, its columns are fully double the average
height of the great circle, and it must have presented, when perfect,
a far more magnificent and imposing aspect. It is painful to think
that within our own time these most interesting memorials of an era
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>far beyond the date of written records have fallen a prey to ignorance,
in that dangerous transition state when the trammels of superstition
are broken through without being replaced by more elevated principles
of veneration. An intelligent native of Orkney, who appears to
have left his home about 1789, remarks in his MS. notes accompanying
a valuable donation of books relating to the northern islands presented
to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland:&mdash;"If Mr. Daniell's
sketch of the Stones of Stennis (taken in 1818) be at all accurate,
many of them have disappeared, and others fallen to the ground, since
I can remember."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> It was in the immediate neighbourhood of the
smaller circle of Stennis that the Stone of Odin stood, completing,
along with the adjacent earth-works alluded to in a former chapter,
a group of primitive monuments, which, though inferior in magnitude
to the vast temples of Wiltshire, or of Carnac in Brittany, are
scarcely surpassed in interest even by these remarkable monuments.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Lieutenant Thomas, R.N., to whose liberal communications
of the result of his observations in Orkney I have already
referred, for careful observations and measurements made by him on
the Stones of Stennis, of which the following are the most important
results:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Great Circle of Stennis, or Ring of Brogar, is a deeply entrenched
circular space, containing almost two acres and a half of
superficies, of which the diameter is 366 feet. Around the circumference
of the area, but about thirteen feet within the trench, are the
erect stones, standing at an average distance of eighteen feet apart.
They are totally unhewn, and vary considerably in form and size.
The highest stone was found to be 13.9 feet above the surface, and,
judging from some others which have fallen, it is sunk about eighteen
inches in the ground. The smallest stone is less than six feet, but
the average height is from eight to ten. The breadth varies from
2.6 to 7.9 feet, but the average may be stated at about five feet, and
the thickness about one foot&mdash;all of the old red sandstone formation.</p>

<p>The trench around the area is in good preservation. The edge of
the bank is still sharply defined, as well as the two foot-banks, or entrances,
which are placed exactly opposite to each other. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
no relation to the true or magnetic meridian, but are parallel to the
general direction of the neck of land on which the circle is placed.
The trench is twenty-nine feet in breadth, and about six in depth,
and the entrances are formed by narrow earth-banks across the fosse.</p>

<p>The surface of the inclosed area has an average inclination to the
eastward. It is highest on the north-west quarter; and the extreme
difference of level is estimated to be from six to seven feet. The
trench has the same inclination, and therefore could never be designed
to hold water.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Stennis seems to have been consecrated
ground to the ancient Orcadians. Within no great distance there are
two circles of standing stones, two others all the remaining stones
of which are prostrate, and four single standing stones, besides about
twenty tumuli of various forms and sizes.</p>

<p>It was long the fashion with antiquaries to receive as an established
and altogether incontrovertible position the Druidical origin
of all symmetrical groups of standing stones in the British Isles.
The more careful researches of later writers into the early history of
the Orkney and Shetland Isles, and of their intimate connexion with
Scandinavia prior to the Christian era, have led to a revision of this
opinion, and to an almost universal abandonment of a Druidical for
a Scandinavian origin of the great Temple of Stennis, and the numerous
other corresponding structures in the north of Scotland and
the Western Isles. Barry, Hibbert, Scott, and Macculloch have each
assailed the old Druidical fancies with considerable learning and
ability. "Dr. Macculloch," says Dr. Hibbert, "has wielded the
hammer of Thor with very signal success in aid of the demolition of
the Druidic theory." But notwithstanding so powerful an array of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
authorities in support of this newer line of argument, I venture to
think, that when the exclusive Scandinavian theory shall have been
demolished with equally signal success, we shall be nearer the truth
than has been yet attained. The common Gaelic phrase&mdash;<i>Am bheil</i>
<i>thu dol do'n chlachan</i>,&mdash;Are you going to the stones? by which the
Scottish Highlander still inquires at a neighbour if he is bound for
church, seems in itself no doubtful tradition of ancient worship within
the monolithic ring. Yet it has already been shewn that some of
these were not temples but sepulchral monuments; nor is their uniformity
sufficiently marked to prove a common origin for all. Sir
Walter Scott remarks, in his Abstract of the Eyrbiggia Saga:<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>&mdash;"The
Temple of Thor is described as a circular range of upright
stones, within which one more eminent marked the Stone of Thor,
where human victims were immolated to the Thunderer, by breaking
or crushing the spine. And this description may confute those antiquaries
who are disposed to refer such circles exclusively to the
Celtic tribes, and their priests, the Druids." Dr. Hibbert has quoted
this paragraph as a refutation of those who would contend that the
Temples of Orkney had been used by Celtic tribes, before they were
occupied and dedicated anew by later Scandinavian worshippers.
But it unfortunately happens in this, as in too many other instances,
that the "Abstract" furnishes a very partial rendering of the original
saga; where the Temple of Thor is described as a vast inclosed edifice,
with chambers constructed of wood, and a chancel or sacrarium specially
dedicated to the Deity, of which the stone circle formed only
one of its complicated features.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Doubtless in some at least of the
monolithic groups still standing, we see but the skeleton of structures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>which have outlived many no less indispensable features of the original
plan, formed of more perishable materials. Modern agricultural
operations have occasionally brought to light very obvious evidences
of this. An intelligent observer who resided on the spot, and closely
watched the operations of the workmen employed in trenching and
levelling the site of a "Druidical Circle" on Donside, in the parish
of Tullynessle, Aberdeenshire, has furnished the following account of
their disclosures:&mdash;"The upright stones were mostly gone; but it
was evident that they had inclosed a circle of about fifty feet diameter.
The ground on which the temple stood was sloping, and
within the circle it had been levelled by removing the earth on the
upper side, so as to present a bank, nearly perpendicular, of not less
than five feet, gradually decreasing to the east or lower part, when it
became level. The upright stones were on the top of the bank.
From the circle, in a south-east direction, a paved road could be
traced to the distance of at least six hundred yards through a bog,
which at the farther end was about six yards wide, but nearly twenty
yards wide when it approached within fifty yards of the circle, and
here the paving was covered with ashes. The stones were not
squared, but very neatly fitted into each other."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In the course of these
operations two curious stone vessels were found, hereafter described,
one of which is now in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.
But the differences are so striking among many of the Scottish monolithic
groups, that we look in vain for evidences of uniformity of faith
or object in their builders. Some are single circles, others several
concentric circles. There are ovals, ellipses, and semicircles, and even
cruciform groups, which a hasty generalizer might accept as an evidence
of primitive Christian art. But one thing is common to the
whole, and is found to characterize similar structures throughout
Europe and Asia&mdash;and that is the huge unhewn monolithic columns,
the evidence not of one creed, but of one remarkable phase of the
human mind, the influence of which has long since disappeared.
Diverse as were the Celtic and Scandinavian creeds, their temples
were probably of similar character; and the rude Norsemen who possessed
themselves of the Orkney Islands in the ninth century, found
far less difficulty in adapting the Temple of Stennis to the shrine of
Thor, than the Protestants of the sixteenth century had to contend
with when they appropriated the old Cathedral of St. Magnus to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>rites of Presbyterian worship. It is unquestionably opposed to
all probability that the Great Circle of Stennis, with its grand but
rude monoliths, was the work of the Norse rovers of the ninth century,
seeing we have good reason to believe that the Christian missionaries
of Iona, or the disciples of St. Servanus, had long before
waged successful war with the Pagan creed of the native Orcadians.
But the question of Scandinavian origin is fortunately put to rest, at
least in the case of this the most remarkable of all the Scottish
temple groups. Professor Munch of Christiania, who visited this
country in 1849, with a view to investigate the traces of Norwegian
intercourse with Scotland, was gratified by the discovery that the
name of Havardsteigr, which was conferred on the scene of Earl
Havard's slaughter by his nephew, about the year 970, is still applied
among the peasantry to the promontory of Stennis; the Stones of
which we may well believe were grey with the moss of centuries ere
the first Norwegian prow touched the shores of Pomona.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> No direct
reference to Stennis occurs in the Orkneyinga Saga, but the remarkable
passage referred to is to be found in that of Olaf Trygvesson,
where it is said:&mdash;"Havard was then at Steinsnes, in Rossey. There
was meeting and battle about Havard, and it was not long ere the
Jarl fell. The place is now called Havardsteigr." So was it called
in the tenth century, and so, Mr. George Petrie writes me, it is still
occasionally named by the peasantry at the present day.</p>

<p>A few examples of the most remarkable monolithic structures of
the Scottish mainland may be noted here. Careful and minute accounts
have already been furnished of those of Inverness-shire by Mr.
George Anderson in the Archæologia Scotica;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and of those of
Aberdeenshire, Argyleshire, and various other Scottish districts, in a
series of illustrated papers in the Archæologia.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The varieties apparent
in their grouping and structure are such as may well justify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>the conclusion that instead of being the temples of a common faith,
they are more probably the ruins of a variety of edifices designed for
diverse purposes, and it may be even for the rites of rival creeds.
This at least is certain, that the latest if not the only unquestionable
evidence of their use which we possess is not as religious temples but
as courts of law and battle-rings, wherein the duel or judicial combat
was fought, though this doubtless had its origin in the invariable union
of the priestly and judicial offices in a primitive state of society. The
several concentric circles so frequently characterizing them, add to
the probability of their adaptation to the purpose of judicial or deliberative
assemblies. Such is one of the most common marks of the
Law Tings of Orkney and Shetland, and of the Isle of Man. "Not
unfrequently the fences of a ting were concentric; the intent of which
was to preserve among the different personages of the ting a proper
distinction of rank. The central area was always occupied by the
laugman, and 'those who stood with him;' and the outer spaces by
the laugrettmen, out of whom the duradom was selected, the contending
parties, and the compurgators."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Mr. George Petrie has
called my attention to several evidences of this in relation to the
Orkney circles, and no less remarkable proofs appear in various chartularies
and other authentic records, showing at how early a period all
ideas of association with the rites of Pagan superstition had been lost.
Thus in the Aberdeen Chartulary a notice occurs of a court held
"apud stantes lapides de Rane en le Garuiach," on the 2d May 1349,
when William de St. Michael was summoned to answer for his forcible
retention of certain ecclesiastical property;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and again in the Chartulary
of Moray the Bishop of Moray is summoned, in the year 1380, to
attend the court of Alexander, Lord of Regality of Badenoch, and son
of Robert II., to be holden "apud le standand stanys de la Rathe de
Kyngucy estir." Part of the business of the court was to inquire
into the titles by which the Bishop held certain of his lands, and as
he is summoned as a vassal, and had to protest against the proceedings,
he is described as standing "<i>extra circum</i>."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The temple group at Leuchar, in the parish of Skene, Aberdeenshire,
consists of a circle measuring internally thirty-four feet in diameter,
composed of eight large stones disposed at regular intervals.
In the centre of this another circle is formed of smaller stones, mea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>suring
about thirteen feet in diameter, and around it six smaller
stone circles are disposed, two of them touching one another, and the
remainder separated by regular intervals. At a short distance from
this group, nine other circles occur, similar to the smaller ones, and
two large cairns occupy commanding sites in the neighbourhood.
Other examples of combinations of circles somewhat resembling this
have been noted; and many of the larger ones have a stone laid flat-ways
in the circumference of the circle, which is usually designated
the altar stone. Concentric circles are still more common. The great
temple or Clachan of Inches, situated about two miles south of Inverness,
is the largest and most entire in that part of the country. It
consists of two circles, the inner one of which is composed of twenty-eight
stones, and measures about forty feet in diameter. The outer
circle is now only partially traceable. Fifteen stones remain, including
one nine feet in height above ground, and the diameter measures above
seventy feet. Another remarkable group occurs about half-a-mile eastward
from a stone avenue near the farm of Milltown of Culloden,
which may possibly have been once connected with it. Three concentric
circles are nearly united to an adjoining one which incloses a
group of five cairns, or what might be more accurately described as
one gigantic cruciform cairn. The contents of this singular structure
would probably amply repay the archæologist for the labour and cost
of exploration. In 1824 Henry Jardine, Esq., King's Remembrancer,
exhibited at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, a
sceptre or rod of office, dug up in the circle of Leys, Inverness-shire.
It consisted of a rod of pure gold, bent at top like an Episcopal crozier
or Roman <i>lituus</i>, which it is not unreasonable to imagine may have
been borne by some ancient arch-priest or king in the great assemblies
of his people. A golden funicular rod made of three pieces twisted
together, and with a solid hook at each end, was dug up in County
Antrim in 1808.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Monolithic groups abound in many parts of the mainland as well
as in the Western Isles, but nearly all characterized by some peculiarity.
Some are inclosed by a trench, others by a fosse; and frequently
the space between the great stones is filled up by an earthen
wall. In several districts in the south of Scotland single and double
ovals are found, and fragments of ancient groups, more or less imperfect,
are common throughout the country. The woodcut represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
an imposing monolithic group in the neighbourhood of Pitlochrie,
Perthshire. One of the great level Highland moors stretches away
beneath the eye, like a dark waveless lake, contrasting with the distant
heights, among which Benlawers rears its pyramidal summit to an
elevation of upwards of 4000 feet above the level of the sea. Amid
this wild Highland landscape the huge standing stones, grey with the
moss of ages, produce a singularly grand and imposing effect; and
from the idea of lofty height which the distant mountains suggest,
they convey a stronger impression of gigantic proportions than is produced
even by the first sight of the giant monoliths of Salisbury Plain.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Standing Stones at Pitlochrie.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most remarkable of the Hebridean groups is that of Classernish,
near Loch Roag, in the island of Lewis. It consists of a
circle sixty-three feet in diameter, with a column in the centre measuring
thirteen feet in height, and an avenue of similar stones stretching
to the north, while single rows placed towards the other cardinal
points complete the cruciform arrangement of the whole. Its greatest
length is stated by Logan as 558 feet, and by Macculloch as about 680
feet; but many of the stones are nearly buried in the moss, so that its
extreme limits are very imperfectly defined. It appears to have consisted
originally of about seventy columns, and smaller circles in the
same neighbourhood attest the ancient presence of a numerous population
on the long desolate waste, where the grey columns of Classernish
are still imposing in their ruins. The magnitude and singularity
of this monolithic group have excited the enthusiasm of Celtic antiquaries,
some of whom have discovered in it the very hyperborean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
temple of the ancients, in which, according to Eratosthenes, Apollo
hid his golden arrow!<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But perhaps the most interesting of all the
temple groups of the Hebrides, is one which furnishes the same indisputable
evidence of remote antiquity to which repeated reference has
been made. It may perhaps be thought a more potent weapon even than
the hammer of Thor, in demolishing the exclusively Scandinavian
theory of their origin. In the same island of Lewis a large stone circle
may be seen, which within memory of the present generation was so
nearly buried in the moss that the surrounding heather and rushes sufficed
to conceal the stones. It has now been cleared out to a depth of
fifteen feet, by the annual operations of the islanders, in cutting peats
for their winter fuel, and as yet without exposing the bases of any of
the columns. My authority for this interesting fact is Dr. Macdonald,
a gentleman who resided for some years as a medical practitioner on
the island, during which time he was accustomed to watch the progressive
exhumation of the long-buried Celtic temple with mingled
feelings of interest and curiosity. But this is not a solitary example.
On various parts of the mainland monolithic groups still remain partially
entombed in the slowly accumulating mosses, the growth of
unnumbered centuries. On one of the wildest moors in the parish of
Tongland, Kirkcudbrightshire, a similar example may be seen, consisting
of a circle of eleven stones, with a twelfth of larger dimensions
in the centre, the summits of the whole just appearing above the
moss. Adjoining the group there stands a large cairn with its base
doubtless resting on the older soil beneath. With such evidence at
command, it is manifest that however vague many of the speculations
may be which have aimed at the elucidation of rites and opinions of
the Celtic Druids, and have too often substituted mere theory for
true archæological induction, we shall run to an opposite error in ascribing
to a Scandinavian origin structures manifestly in existence
long prior to the earliest Norwegian or Danish, or even perhaps Celtic,
descent on our coasts.</p>

<p>The Scottish cromlech, which belongs to the same period as the
standing stones and circular temples, has already been referred to
under its true head of Sepulchral Memorials; it need only be added,
that some at least of the smaller stone circles appear to belong to the
same class, and to have been only the encircling monument that
marked out the spot consecrated by the dust of some mighty chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
or formed subsidiary features of a group in which the ruined cromlech
still forms the most prominent object. But the idea of a temple has
become so indelibly associated even in the minds of intelligent antiquaries
with the circle of standing stones, that even when such circles
are found in groups, the convenient name is still retained. "Nearly
in a line between East and West Law, Fifeshire," says Lieutenant-Colonel
Miller, in his inquiry respecting the site of Mons Grampius,
"there are no less than eight Druidical temples." To account for
such a state of things we shall next be compelled to assume that old
Scottish Druidism was split into even more rival sects than modern
Scottish Presbytery, and perhaps be taught to decipher from the
symbolism of the rude monoliths, their number, or their orientation,
the degree of heresy that characterized each Druidical conventicle!
Such speculations cannot, after all, surpass the extravagant and baseless
theories of Sabaism, fire-worship, Druidism, astrology, &amp;c., which
have been already deduced from the number of stones, the direction
of the entrance, or other equally slight and constantly varying elements
of argument.</p>

<p>One other and still more remarkable, class of works remains to be
noted: These are the Rocking Stones, which are found among the
ancient monuments of England and Ireland, as well as on various
parts of the Continent, and are no less frequent in Scotland. No
evidences of ancient skill or of primitive superstitious rites are more
calculated to awaken our astonishment and admiration of their singular
constructors. There is so strange a mixture of extreme rudeness
and great mechanical skill in these memorials of the remote past,
that they excite greater wonder and awe in the thoughtful mind than
even the imposing masses inclosing the sacred area of Stonehenge or
the circle of Stennis. It would, I imagine, prove a much more complicated
problem for the modern engineer to poise the irregular and
amorphous mass on its point of equilibrium, than to rear the largest
monolithic group that now stands to attest the mechanical power
which the old builders could command.</p>

<p>It has indeed been supposed by some that the origin of Rocking
Stones is traceable entirely to natural causes, and this opinion is now
adopted by Worsaae and other Danish and Norwegian antiquaries.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Such a theory, however, seems to stand fully as much in need of
proof as that which regards them as stones of ordeal, by which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Druid or Scandinavian priests were wont to test the guilt or innocence
of the accused. Apollonius Rhodius speaks of rocking stones placed
on the apex of tumuli, and Mr. Akerman refers, in his Archæological
Index, to the famous Agglestone Barrow, in the island of Purbeck, as
having been similarly surmounted.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> One such undoubted example
would abundantly suffice to overthrow this geological theory of natural
formation. It is a less conclusive, though not altogether valueless
argument, that some of the most remarkable logan stones of Scotland
are found in the immediate vicinity of other undoubted primitive
stone-works. The great rocking stone in the parish of
Kirkmichael, Perthshire, for example, has already been referred to
as one of a large group of stone circles, cairns, and other monuments
of the same class. Its form is that of a rhombus, of which the
greater diagonal is seven feet, and the less five feet, and its weight is
calculated at about three tons and half a hundredweight. On pressing
down either of the extreme corners, a rocking motion is produced,
which increases until the arc through which its longest radius moves
exceeds a foot. When the pressure has been continued so as to produce
this effect, the stone makes from twenty-six to twenty-eight
vibrations from side to side after it is withdrawn. A much larger
rocking stone is situated on the Hill of Mealyea, in the parish of
Kells, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. Its weight is estimated at from
eight to ten tons, and it is so nicely poised that it can be set in motion
with the pressure of the finger. To this the name of the Logan
Stone is popularly applied in the Stewartry, therein corresponding
with the term used in Cornwall and other districts of England.
A second rocking stone formerly existed on the same range of hills,
but it was thrown down about thirty years since. Others remain in
the parish of Dron, Perthshire, on a hill in the neighbourhood of the
manse; in the parish of Abernethy, celebrated for its venerable ecclesiastical
relics; and on the north side of the Cuff Hill, in the parish
of Beith, Ayrshire; but none of them present any very special
peculiarity worthy of note. It is not designed to offer a new theory
here concerning the purpose of these singular "Stones of Ordeal;"
nor even to pronounce on the certainty of their artificial origin;
but I cannot help thinking it opposed to every doctrine of probabilities,
that nature in the course of her ceaseless operations of
denudation and attrition should in so many instances have <i>chanced</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>to wear away an amorphous rock so as to leave it poised in its
centre of gravity on a single point. So numerous are the examples
of rocking stones, that those who assign to them a natural origin
would seem justified in anticipating the discovery of some unknown
law of nature tending to such a result. But even if this extravagant
doctrine of their origin is adopted, the rocking stones will
still justly come within the range of archæological studies, as it can
hardly admit of a doubt that they were objects of reverent estimation
by the old monolithic builders. It is rare to find them far removed
from a stone circle or other primitive structure, which may
indeed have owed its erection to the prior existence of the rocking
stone, but would more naturally suggest the old conclusion that
also originated in the same laborious contrivance and skill which
reared the ponderous dolmens, cromlechs, and monolithic groups already
described.</p>

minute account is given in an earlier portion
of the Saga, where Thorolf ascertains
the destined site of the new temple by casting
its wooden pillars into the sea, and
accepting as the sacred spot a promontory
to which they were borne by the tides.
This is the description of the erection, which
it will be seen is something different from
a mere circle of stones:&mdash;"At Hofsvog he
caused a temple to be erected, a house of
vast magnitude, with doors in the side wall,
somewhat near to either extremity. Within
the doors were the pillars of the chief seat,
secured with nails, and called sacred or
divine. In the interior another chamber
was constructed in the shape which the
chancels of churches now have, in the
middle of the pavement of which stood the
pulvinar, as well as the altar," &amp;c. <i>Vide</i>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

WEAPONS AND IMPLEMENTS.</h3>


<p>The singular correspondence between many of the weapons and
implements of the Stone Period, in almost every quarter of the globe,
has already been referred to; but there are not wanting many others
presenting such national and local peculiarities as are worthy of careful
noting and comparison. In this respect much still remains to be
done for Scottish Archæology. A far more abundant store of materials,
and a much larger class of intelligent and educated observers
are required, before the subject can be placed in its true light as an
elementary basis from whence to deduce the legitimate inferences involved
in this branch of science. It will meanwhile help towards
the establishment of a fixed nomenclature and the basis of more extended
classification, as observers increase, to exhibit at one view the
chief known varieties of the weapons and implements of the Scottish
Stone Period.</p>

<p>The rude and unshapely fragments of flint known by the name of
Flint Flakes, and now recognised as specimens of the first stages of
weapon manufacture of the period to which they belong, have only
very recently fully attracted the attention of archæologists. The
merit in this, as in so many other important elementary principles of
the science, is due to the intelligence and sagacity of the antiquaries
of Copenhagen, and the admirable facilities afforded by the liberality
of the Danish Government. The flakes of flint, which are met with
in considerable abundance, appear to have been struck off from a solid
mass. They are ordinarily found from about one to six inches long,
and frequently present a curved form, it being apparently a property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of flint to flake off in this manner. Sometimes they occur in the
simplest state; in other cases they are partially reduced to their intended
form. But rude as they are, they are of the utmost value to
us, from the insight which is thereby obtained into the process of
manufactory of the primitive lance and arrow-head. It is obvious,
from the frequent discovery of such among sepulchral deposits, that
considerable value was attached to them; nor must we overlook the
fact, that while flint is found in the greatest abundance both in
Denmark and the south of England, there are many parts of Scotland
where it is scarcely to be met with. Here, therefore, we discover the
first traces of primitive trading and barter. The flint flakes were, in
fact, the <i>raw material</i>, which had to be imported from other districts
before the hunter of the Stone Period could supply himself with the
indispensable requisites for the chase. A few examples will suffice to
shew the abundance of such materials, and the circumstances under
which they are found, though it will readily be believed that it is only
rarely that their occurrence is noted, or falls under the observation of
those who consider them of the slightest value.</p>

<p>In one of the cases in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland there is a skull found in an ancient cist, on the farm of
Clashfarquhar, parish of Banchory-Devenich, Aberdeenshire, in 1822.
It is chiefly curious from having on the crown of the head a hole
nearly circular, and rather more than an inch in diameter, which there
can be little doubt was occasioned by the death-blow. The size and
cerebral development of the head nearly resembles the usual character
of skulls found in the earliest cists; and it is not difficult to conceive
of the wound having been inflicted with the narrow end of a stone
celt. In each corner of the cist a few flint flakes were carefully piled
up into a little heap. Alexander Thomson, Esq. of Banchory, remarks
of them, in a letter which accompanied the donation of the skull:&mdash;"They
are very proper for being made into arrow-heads, but none of
them appear to have been wrought."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Similar relics of early art have
been noted at various times in the same district of the country:&mdash;"On
the alluvial soil near the sea," remarks the author of the New Statistical
Account of Belhelvie, "there is a bed of yellow flints, in which
a number of very well formed arrow-heads are frequently found;" and
in no part of Scotland are these primitive relics more abundant than
in the landward districts of Aberdeenshire. In the large cairn of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Menzie, on Cairn Moor, Buchan, there was found, in a stone cist,
"along with earth and bones, a dart-head of yellow flint, most perfectly
shaped, and a little block, also of yellow flint, as if intended to
furnish the deceased with more darts, should he have occasion for
them on the passage."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In 1821 several flint flakes, and imperfectly
formed flint implements, were found, along with two perfect arrow-heads
of the same material, in an urn containing incinerated bones,
on the estate of Closeburn, Dumfriesshire. The urn, and several of
the half-formed flints, are now in the Scottish Museum. A similar
deposit was discovered only last year (1849) by workmen engaged in
digging for stones to build a march dyke between the farm of Swinie
and an adjoining one on the neighbouring estate of Wells, Roxburghshire.
There were four cairns, two of which, on being demolished,
disclosed cists containing urns, and beside them a quantity of flint
flakes of various sizes, several of which are now in my possession.
Similar examples are of frequent occurrence, but one other may be
noted from the unusual amount of flint flakes found with it. North
of the Mull of Islay, Argyleshire, there is a road which leads from
Port Ellen, in a north-easterly direction, towards the shooting lodge
of Islay. At a point in this road, where it is cut into the side of the
hill, distant about four miles from Port Ellen, some workmen engaged
in widening the road exposed a cist in cutting into the sloping
ground, within which lay a skeleton with a large quantity of flint
flakes and chips beside it. A distinguished artist, who happened
fortunately to be in the neighbourhood at the time of this interesting
discovery, has furnished me with sketches of the locality. He describes
the flint flakes as so numerous, that they formed a heap of
from eighteen inches to two feet in height when removed from the
cist.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Other and scarcely less interesting evidences of ancient population
are still observable in remote nooks of the Western Highlands, where
the Dalriadic Scots first effected a settlement in the land which has
borne their name for so many centuries. The road from Port Ellen
to the site of the ancient cist, above described, passes for a considerable
way through a narrow winding valley, studded with huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>boulders and detached masses of rock, preserving evidences of remarkable
geological changes many ages anterior to the earliest occurrence
within the range of archæological science. Similar evidences
are of frequent occurrence along these western shores, where now the
restless Atlantic is slowly but unceasingly gnawing the rocky coast
into wilder and more picturesque forms, while it strews the stolen
debris on its ocean bed, to form new strata and continents for younger
worlds than ours. With these evidences of change we have not now
to deal. But in various districts of the same neighbourhood, and particularly
amid the scenes on which a new interest has been conferred
as those in which the poet Campbell passed some of his early years,
the curious traveller may descry, amid "the desolate heath" of the
poet,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> indications on the hill-sides of a degree of cultivation having
existed at some former period far beyond what is exhibited in that
locality at the present day. The soil on the sloping sides of the hills
appears to have been retained by dwarf walls, and these singular terraces
occur frequently at such altitudes as must convey a remarkably
vivid idea of the extent and industry of an ancient population, where
now the grazing of a few black cattle alone tempts to the claim
of property in the soil. In other districts the half-obliterated furrows
are still traceable on heights which have been abandoned for
ages to the wild fox or the eagle. Such evidences of ancient population
and industry are by no means confined to the remote districts of
ancient Dalriada. They occur in many parts of Scotland, startling the
believer in the unmitigated barbarism of Scotland prior to the medieval
era with evidence of a state of prosperity and civilisation at some
remote epoch, the date of which has yet to be ascertained; though
there are not wanting periods within the era of authentic Scottish
history to which some of these may with considerable probability be
assigned. The very simple explanation of such ancient plough-marks
which has satisfied the popular mind is apparent in the appellation
of <i>elf furrows</i>, by which they are commonly known. The prevalence
of these infallible tokens of former industry was noted by the Rev.
George Maxwell when drawing up an account of the parish of Buittle,
in Galloway, towards the close of last century. The rustic tradition
by which the reverend Statist seeks to account for the greater agricultural
skill of former ages, though amusing enough, is not without
its value to us from the proof it affords of the extent to which such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>traces must have existed when they made so great an impression
on the popular mind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is here to be observed," he remarks, "that there are few hills in this part
of Galloway, where cultivation is at all practicable, that do not bear distinct marks
of the plough. The depths of the furrows, too, plainly declare that this tillage
has not been casual, or merely experimental, but frequent and successive. This
should set both the ancient population and industry of this part of Scotland in a
more favourable light than that in which they are usually held. It also affords
probability to a tradition repeated by the country people to this day: that at a
time when Scotland was under a Papal interdict, or sentence of cursing from the
Pope, it was found that his Holiness had forgot to curse the hills, though he had
commanded the land, usually arable, to yield no increase; and that while this
sentence remained, the people were necessitated to seek tillage ground in places
unusual and improbable!"<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p></div>

<p>Returning, however, from this digression, to the consideration of
the rude primitive implements of stone and flint, and the flint flakes
out of which the latter were formed,&mdash;the flint arrow and lance heads
constructed from these furnish evidence of much patient ingenuity,
and exhibit considerable variety of form. It is difficult, indeed, to
conceive of the process by which workmen, provided with such imperfect
tools as we must presume them to have possessed, were able to
split the flint into flakes, and reduce these to such regular forms. The
remoteness of the period when this primitive art was superseded by
the workers in metal, is proved by the incorporation of the ancient
flint implements into some of the most prevalent popular superstitions
of the north. The terms Elf-bolt, Elf-shot, or Elfin-arrow, are invariably
applied to the flint arrow-head throughout the Scottish Lowlands.
The Gaelic name, <i>Sciat-hee</i>, is completely synonymous; while
in Shetland and Orkney the idea of their supernatural origin is more
frequently conveyed by the term thunderbolt, invariably applied to
the stone celt. This variation in the popular mode of giving expression
to the idea of the supernatural origin of these primitive
weapons, among the inhabitants of the mainland and the northern
isles of Scotland, is worthy of passing note, from the evidence it affords
of one well-defined early date to which we may refer as a known
period when the stone weapons were fully as much relics of a remote
past, and objects of popular wonder, as now. The name still
applied to the Elf-bolt, by the Norwegian peasantry, is <i>Tordenkiler</i>,
or thunderstone,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> so that we can feel little hesitation in assigning to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>the old Norse colonists of Orkney, the difference still discernible in
these expressions of the same popular idea, and inferring from thence,
what all other evidence confirms, that the Scottish Stone Period
belongs to an era many centuries prior to the oldest date of her
written history. The Elf-bolt is associated with many rustic fancies
not yet altogether eradicated from the popular mind. It occupied
no unimportant part among the paraphernalia of Scottish witches of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and the occurrence of any
sudden disease amongst cattle was ascribed until a comparatively
recent period, to their having been shot by the fairies with Elfin
arrows. This ancient superstition is not peculiar to Scotland. In
Norway similar diseases, not only of cattle but of men, were called
by the same name of <i>Alfskot</i>, and in Denmark, of <i>Elveskud</i>, that is,
Elf-shot; though the flint arrow-head is not recognised as the bolt
which furnishes for such purposes the quivers of the malignant elves.
But other, and probably more ancient Scandinavian legends, prove
the existence of similar northern associations with the primitive
arrow-head of flint. In the "<i>Fornaldar S&ouml;gur Nordlanda</i>," or Legends
from the primitive period of the North, derived from ancient manuscripts,
Orvar Odd's Saga furnishes a curious evidence of this,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Orvar Odd, who is already furnished with three iron arrows, the gift of Guse,
a Fin king possessed of magic power, in the course of his wanderings is hospitably
entertained by an old man of singular appearance. On the side where the old
man sat he laid three stone arrows on the table near the dish. They were so
large and handsome that Orvar thought he had never seen anything like them.
He took them up and looked at them, saying, "These arrows are well made." "If
you really think them to be so," replied his host, "I shall make you a present of
them." "I do not think," replied Orvar, smiling, "that I need cumber myself
with stone arrows." The old man answered, "Be not sure that you will not some
time stand in need of them. I know that you possess three arrows, called the
Guse's gifts, but, though you deem it unlikely, it may happen that the Guse's
weapons prove useless, then these stone arrows will avail you." Orvar Odd
accordingly receives the gift, and chancing soon after to encounter a foe who by like
magic was impenetrable to all ordinary weapons, he transfixes him with the stone
arrows, which immediately vanish.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p></div>

<p>From references to the geographical divisions of Russia, as well as
other internal evidence, this version of the legend is believed to have
been written not later than the twelfth century. The tradition,
however, is doubtless based on a much older belief, so that we cannot
err in assuming that at the earliest period of intercourse between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Scotland and Norway, sufficiently frequent to assimilate the popular
superstition of the two countries, the Stone Period was only known
as a state of society so essentially different from every historic tradition
with which the people were familiar, that they referred its
weapons and implements to the same invisible sprites by whose
agency they were wont to account for all incomprehensible or superhuman
occurrences.</p>

<p>The Elf-arrow was almost universally esteemed throughout Scotland
as an amulet or charm, equally effectual against the malice of Elfin
sprites, and the spells of witchcraft. Dipt in the water which cattle
were to drink, it was supposed to be the most effectual cure for their
diseases, while sewed in the dress, it was no less available for the
protection of the human race; and it is still occasionally to be met
with perforated or set in gold or silver, for wearing as an amulet.
Like other weapons of Elfin artillery, it was supposed to retain its influence
at the will of the possessor, and thus became the most effective
talisman against elvish malice, witchcraft, or the evil-eye, when in
the hands of man. Such traditional myths of vulgar superstition are
not without their value, however humble their direct origin may be.
They are frequently only distorted images of important truths, and
we shall find more than one occasion to recur to them for aid in reuniting
the broken skein of primitive history. To follow out the
simile, it may sometimes be said of them with truth, that where all
other lines of connexion with the past are broken, these are only
ravelled and confused.</p>

<p>Arrow-heads of the Stone Period are found in Scotland in great
numbers, and of a considerable variety of forms. They are for the
most part made of silex, though also met with of agate, cornelian,
and other native pebbles, and are frequently finished with much neatness
and care. The woodcut exhibits a very fine one, the full size of
the original, which was found in the Isle of Skye, and is now in the
collection of Mr. John Bell of Dungannon. Pennant has engraved
a large cinerary urn, discovered along with three others, on opening
a cairn on the hill of Down, near Banff. They contained, in addition
to the incinerated remains, bone implements and flint arrow-heads,
the largest of them having in it thirteen of the latter, all of the shape
to which the term <i>barbed</i> is most commonly applied. This, indeed,
while it appears to be one of the most artificial forms, involving the
greatest amount of labour and skill in fashioning the material, is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
one of most frequent occurrence in Scotland. Those already referred
to as found, along with an ancient wooden wheel, in the Blair-Drummond
Moss, were of the same shape. So
also were some obtained on opening a tumulus
in the parish of Killearn, Stirlingshire,
during the past year; and indeed
they have been met with in nearly every
district of the mainland, and of the northern
and western isles. Lance- and spear-heads
of silex are also not uncommon,
both in the tumuli and among the objects
turned up where the scenes of primitive
population are subjected for the first time
to the plough. A very fine spear-head of
silex, fifteen inches long, and beautifully
finished, was discovered a few years since
on the demolition of a cairn on the estate
of Craigengelt, near Stirling. Another of
somewhat smaller dimensions, also found
in a cairn, on the estate of John Guthrie,
Esq., Forfarshire, about 1796, is figured
and described in the Gentleman's Magazine
of the following year.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Flint knives, though apparently less
abundant than in the different Scandinavian
countries, and especially in Denmark,
are frequently turned up in the course of agricultural operations. In
no instance that has come under my notice have implements been
found in Scotland exactly resembling the curious lunar flint knives
and saws of such common occurrence in Denmark and Sweden; yet
examples of similar form are familiar to American archæologists
among the singular contents of the great mounds explored of late years
in the valley of the Mississippi, and in other districts of the North
American continent. These are generally made of slate, and stone knives
analogous to them appear also to have been used in the Scottish primitive
periods, to supply similar necessities. In the Shetland and Orkney
islands especially stone knives are common, and in other districts
knives of flint, though not of the northern lunar shape, are often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
met with. It is perhaps of fully as much importance, in the present
stage of archæological inquiries, to note the dissimilarity, as the correspondence
of relics of the same period in different countries. We
have already observed a resemblance so remarkable, in the implements
of the Stone Period pertaining to countries alike separated by time
and space, as to preclude the possibility of ascribing it to any mutual
intercourse or common source of knowledge, that nothing but a
correspondence in many minute details will justify the inference of
international intercourse or similarity of races. Dissimilarity, however,
in these primitive implements, if the means of comparison be
sufficiently extensive, may suffice to establish the opposite conclusion,
that little or no intercourse had existed between Scotland
and those countries, such as Norway and Sweden, at least during
the earliest historic periods. Little proof, indeed, is required to
establish this&mdash;if we set aside the opinion, assumed without any
investigation of the evidence, that the natives of ancient Caledonia
lagged far behind the other races of Northern Europe in the arts of
civilisation&mdash;for their primitive arts precluded the construction of
fleets fitted for the navigation of the intermediate seas, and shut them
up to their own native ingenuity. Still it may be that the discovery
of a more complete correspondence with the stone implements of
other parts of Europe will yet add to our knowledge of the first
colonisation of the British Isles, and help us to follow back the track
of these nomadic tribes in their wanderings from the eastern cradle
land of the human race.</p>

<p>One of the most curious stone implements of frequent occurrence in
the northern islands is what the Shetlanders style a Pech's knife. They
have already been referred to as partially resembling the lunar flint
knives of Norway and Denmark. But in the Scottish examples the
semicircular edge is sharp, while the straight side is thickened like
the back of a common knife. Others are oval, or irregular in form,
and brought to an edge round the whole circumference. One of the
latter, in the Scottish Antiquarian Museum, formed of thin laminæ
of madreporite, was found at one of the burghs or round towers
of Shetland. It measures 4&frac12; by 4 inches, and does not exceed, in
greatest thickness, the tenth of an inch. Similar implements, in
the collection of the London Antiquaries at Somerset House, are
mentioned by Mr. Albert Way,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> as probably the ancient stone in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>struments
transmitted to Sir Joseph Banks by Mr. Scott of Lerwick,
in Shetland, and communicated to the Society, March 9, 1820. Sixteen
were found by a man digging peats in the parish of Walls, Shetland,
placed regularly on an horizontal line, and overlapping each other
like slates upon the roof of a house, each stone standing at an angle
of 45&deg;. They lay at a depth of about six feet in the peat moss, and
the line of stones ran east and west, with the upper edge towards
the east. A considerable number of implements, mostly of the same
class, were found on the clay under the ancient mosses of Blair-Drummond
and Meiklewood. Some of them are composed of slate,
and others of a compact green stone. They are from four to six
inches long, flat, and well polished. There were also along with
them a number of stone celts and axe heads, mostly made of the
same hard green stone. In the Scottish collection is a knife of
an entirely different form, made of light grey flint, which was found,
along with a stone celt of unusual shape, within the area of a
"Druidical circle," in Strachur parish, Argyleshire. Two others,
recently discovered in ploughing a field in the neighbourhood of
Largo, Fifeshire, totally differ from any of the numerous examples
found in Denmark or Sweden. They are bent back at the point,
finished with great care, have a fine edge, and appear to have been
attached to bone or wooden handles. Another example, somewhat
resembling these, was found in cutting a drain on the Pentland Hills,
near Edinburgh, and though simpler, is also peculiar, and apparently
unique in form. On showing it recently to an East-Lothian farmer,
he remarked that he had frequently seen such things turned up by the
plough, but had never thought them worth the trouble of lifting.</p>

<p>Celts<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and hatchets, or wedges, are among the most abundant of all
the relics of the Stone Period. They have been discovered in considerable
quantities in almost every part of Scotland, from the remote Orkney
and Shetland Isles,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> to the shores of the Solway and the banks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>the Tweed. They are frequently found rudely executed, with little
appearance of labour except at the edge; while other examples are
characterized by the highest finish and the utmost degree of polish
that the modern lapidary could confer on them. The manner of attaching
the stone celt to a handle has been made the subject of some discussion,
though sufficiently illustrated by the practice of the modern
Polynesians and other savage tribes still using weapons of stone. M.
Boucher de Perthes has succeeded in throwing some new light on the
subject by researches in the neighbourhood of Abbeville, which point
to the conclusion that the French celt has been inserted into the hollow
portion of a stag's horn having a perforation in it to receive the handle.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Various other methods, however, have been shewn by which this
primitive weapon could be hafted, so as to become available for the
war axe of the northern warrior. The example found in the earliest
ancient canoe of the Clyde, leaves no room to doubt that it was
bound to the handle by thongs or portions of the haft passing round
the middle. Both ends are highly polished, while the middle remains
rough, having evidently been designed to be covered and concealed.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
One stone celt has been found in Ireland, near Cookstone, in the
county of Tyrone, still attached to its wooden handle, the artless
rudeness of which could hardly be surpassed.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Much more efficient
means, however, are frequently seen employed in corresponding
weapons brought from the
South Sea Islands than any
of the ancient examples display;
and these may suffice
to illustrate the improved
methods which experience
would suggest to the rude
Caledonian aborigines.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 546px;">
<img src="images/image130.jpg" width="546" height="475" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Hatchets.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The stone celt must unquestionably
be regarded as
a weapon of war. With its
thick round edge, when
wielded at the end of a long
handle, similar to those to which we see the stone axes of the Polynesian
savages attached, it would prove an effective lethal weapon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>but very few examples of it could be applied to any useful purpose as
tools. The flint or stone hatchet was more probably the implement
which, with the ever-ready aid of fire, sufficed to hew down the oak, to
split and reduce it into requisite forms for domestic uses, or to shape
and hollow it out into such rude canoes as have been described in a
former chapter. Still it is difficult to draw any very definite line of
distinction between the artificer's and the warrior's axe, the same implement
having doubtless been often employed in waging war on the
leafy giants of the old Caledonian forests, and on rival tribes who
found a home within their fastnesses. The most perfect, indeed, of
the stone hatchets seem ill adapted for the laborious task of felling
the knotty oak, and hollowing it for the primitive canoe. But in all
such considerations of savage arts it must be borne in remembrance
that time, which forms so important an element in modern estimate,
hardly comes into account with the savage. Armed with no better
tools, the Red Indian, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, is known
to cut an incision in the bark round the root of the tree destined for
his canoe; into this he places glowing embers until it is charred to
a considerable depth, and by the alternate use of the hatchet and the
fire the largest tree is brought to the ground, and by the same ingenious
process adapted to bear its owner on the open seas.</p>

<p>A very interesting discovery of an example of the use of the stone
battle-axe, or celt, is thus described in a letter from Captain Denniston
to Mr. Train. About the year 1809, Mr. M'Lean of Mark found it
necessary, in the course of some improvements on his farm, to remove
a large cairn on the Moor of Glenquicken, Kirkcudbrightshire, which
popular tradition assigned as the tomb of some unknown Galwegian
king, styled Aldus M'Galdus:&mdash;"When the cairn had been removed,
the workmen came to a stone coffin of very rude workmanship, and
on removing the lid, they found the skeleton of a man of uncommon
size. The bones were in such a state of decomposition, that the ribs
and vertebræ crumbled into dust on attempting to lift them. The
remaining bones being more compact, were taken out, when it was
discovered that one of the arms had been almost separated from the
shoulder by the stroke of a stone axe, and that a fragment of the axe
still remained in the bone. The axe had been of green stone, a species
of stone never found in this part of Scotland. There were also found
with this skeleton a ball of flint, about three inches in diameter,
which was perfectly round and highly polished, and the head of an
arrow, also of flint, but not a particle of any metallic substance."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Many of the most highly-finished celts and hatchets found in Scotland
are made of the same green stone, which is susceptible of a beautiful
polish. Other implements of this period are chisels of flint, nearly
resembling those of Norway and Denmark. Several examples are in
the Scottish Museum; and a curious instance of a perforated chisel,
similar to those frequently found in Denmark, was turned up in
1841, in trenching a piece of ground near the Church of Lismore,
Argyleshire. It is of the usual square form, measuring four inches
long, and is described in the New Statistical Account as a stone
needle.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Another and larger class of Scottish implements are cylindrical
or oval perforated stones, of which no examples, I believe, have
yet been found in Denmark or Sweden. The woodcut represents one
of these implements, measuring
8&frac14; inches in length, found
in a cist near North Berwick
Abbey, East-Lothian, where
many primitive remains have been discovered. It is flattened at the
end where it is perforated, and is made of a very hard polished stone.
Another was found in 1832, in the parish of Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire;
and similar implements are occasionally mentioned among the
contents of Scottish tumuli. In a cist, discovered under a barrow,
in Kirkurd parish, Peeblesshire, there were various weapons of
flint and stone, including one described as resembling the head of a
halbert, another of a circular form, and the third of a cylindrical
shape; in all probability a celt, a spherical flint or stone, and one of
the implements now referred to, which may be conveniently designated
as <i>flail-stones</i>.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> On levelling a large tumulus a few years since,
at Dalpatrick, Lanarkshire, a cist was discovered inclosing an urn.
Two other specimens of fictile ware, one of them supposed to be a
lamp, were found imbedded in the surrounding earth, and also a flail-stone
made of trap rock. It is described as "a curious whinstone, of
a roundish form, about four inches in diameter, perforated with a
circular hole, through which the radicle of an oak growing near the
spot had found its way."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Similar stone implements have been fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>quently
met with in Scotland, and were perhaps designed for use as
offensive weapons, attached to a leather thong or secured by such
means to the end of a shaft, like a modern flail. The Shoshonee
Indians, and other North American tribes, used such a weapon under
the name of a <i>Pogamoggon</i>; the stone not being perforated, but inclosed
in leather, by which it was fastened to the handle. Other
tribes of the Mississippi valley had a simpler form of the same weapon,
possibly corresponding to the spherical relics of flint or stone occasionally
found with these, consisting of a grooved ball attached to a
long leather thong, which they wielded, like a slung-shot, with deadly
effect.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> A medieval offensive weapon, constructed on the same principle,
bore the quaint name of "The Morning Star," an epithet no doubt
suggested by its form; as it consisted of a ball of iron armed with radiating
spikes, attached by a chain to its handle. Like the ruder
flail-stone, the morning star, when efficiently wielded, must have
proved a deadly weapon in the desultory warfare of undisciplined
assailants; but whenever the value of combined operations was discovered
and acted upon it would have to be thrown aside, as probably
more fatal to friends than to enemies. In the Scottish flail-stones
the perforation is bevelled off so as to admit of their free use without
cutting or fraying the thong by which they were held. We shall
not probably greatly err in assuming these to be the first "<i>morning</i>
<i>stars</i>" of that old twilight, in the uncertain light of which we are
groping for some stray truths of the infancy of history.</p>

<p>A stone implement in my own possession, somewhat similar in
general form to these flail-stones, was found beside a group of cists
near North Berwick, East-Lothian, but its original destination is obvious.
It is made of hard sandstone, of a flattened oval form in section,
and is worn on the two alternate sides where it has been used as a
whetstone&mdash;a use for which the hardness and high polish of the others
render them totally unfit.</p>

<p>Not the least curious among the primitive relics in the celebrated
museum of northern antiquities at Copenhagen, are the various whetstones,
some of which have been found in barrows and elsewhere under
ground, with half-finished stone-wedges lying upon them, as if the
workman had been suddenly interrupted by death in the midst of his
laborious industry, and his unaccomplished task had been deemed the
fittest memorial to lay beside him. It formed no part of the old Pagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
creed that "there is no work nor device in the grave." Possibly
enough the buried celt-maker was expected to resume his occupation
and finish his axe-grinding in the spirits' land. No similar example
has yet been noted in Scotland, though smaller hand whetstones,
like the one found at North Berwick, are not uncommon. One which
is described as very smooth and neat, was obtained among the contents
discovered on excavating within the area of the vitrified fort of
Craig Phaidrick, near Inverness;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> several such were found in cists
at Cockenzie, East-Lothian; and Barry mentions among the miscellaneous
contents of the tumuli or cists in the island of Westray,
"a flat piece of marble, of a circular form, about two inches and
a-half in diameter, and several stones, in shape and appearance like
whetstones that had never been used."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Great as are the numbers and varieties of the stone weapons and
implements of Denmark, compared with those found in Britain, they
appear to be surpassed in both respects by the corresponding relics
of the Mexican Stone Period. Such facts suggest the inference,
which history in some degree confirms, that the metallurgic arts
were earlier known in Britain than in Denmark, thereby superseding
the arts of the stone-workers before they had been elaborated as elsewhere;
while in Mexico, Yucatan, and throughout the districts of the
North American continent, where a native civilisation is known to
have prevailed, iron was totally unknown, and copper had not completely
superseded the stone hatchet and arrow-point when Columbus
opened a way to that new world. But who shall say how many more
curious and noteworthy reminiscences of the past may have been
ignorantly destroyed in Scotland, among the thousands of burial-mounds
annually invaded by the unlettered peasant in his agricultural
labours.</p>

<p>Among the larger implements of this period the most remarkable
and varied are the Stone Hammers and Axes. They are of common
occurrence, and present a variety of forms, evidently designed to adapt
them to a considerable diversity of purposes. They are therefore
available as evidence in estimating the degree of inventive talent
manifested in the primitive state of society in which they were
produced, showing as they do the intelligent savage coping with the
untractable materials with which he had to deal, and supplying many
deficiencies by his own ingenuity and skill. With these, as with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>elf-bolts of the same period, we find in the reminiscences of early
superstition the evidence of their frequent occurrence long after all
traces of their origin and uses had been obliterated by the universal
substitution of metallic implements. As we find the little flint arrow-head
associated with Scottish <i>folk-lore</i> as the Elfin's bolt, so the
stone hammer of the same period was adapted to the creed of the
middle ages. The name by which it was popularly known in Scotland
almost till the close of last century was that of the Purgatory
Hammer. Found as it frequently was within the cist and beside the
mouldering bones of its old Pagan possessor, the simple discoverer
could devise no likelier use for it than that it was laid there for its
owner to bear with him "up the trinal steps," and with it thunder
at the gates of purgatory till the heavenly janitor appeared, that he
might</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i27">"ask,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The stone hammer is frequently found in the older cists. In 1832
a farm-servant while ploughing a field on the farm of Downby, in
Orkney, struck his ploughshare on a stone which proved to be the
cover of a cist of the usual contracted dimensions, in which lay a
skeleton that seemed to have been interred in a sitting posture. At
the right hand lay a highly polished mallet-head of gneiss, beautifully
marked with dark and light streaks.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Stone Hammers and Axes.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The examples figured here furnish a few of the most characteristic
varieties of Scottish hammers that have been preserved. They by
no means equal in number those found in Denmark, Sweden, and
Norway. But only a very partial and extremely superficial investi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>gation
of such relics has yet been made, and we possess no national
collection in Scotland, similar to that of the Christiansborg Palace of
Copenhagen, to which the whole available financial and legal machinery
of the kingdom is employed in gathering the primitive national
antiquities so soon as they are discovered. The Old and New
Statistical Accounts abound with notices of opened tumuli and cairns,
and of their valuable archæological contents; but unfortunately in
nearly every case these are either conveniently ascribed to Romans and
Danes, or mentioned so vaguely that no use can be made of them as
illustrations of the period to which they belong.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/image136.jpg" width="331" height="534" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The name of Axe is, with sufficient appropriateness, applied to the
double-edged stone implements, and to those of a wedge-shape which
have the aperture for inserting the handle near the broad end,
whereas other examples perforated sufficiently near the centre to admit
of the free use of both ends are with equal propriety styled hammers.
They are frequently finished with great neatness and art; not made,
like the hatchet, of flint, but of a variety of kinds of stone, from the
gray granite, of which the largest are generally made, to trap and
even sandstone. Several examples have been discovered in an unfinished
state, furnishing curious illustration of the laborious process of
manufacture. One large one in particular in the Scottish Museum was
found in digging the Caledonian Canal.
It is made of gray granite, very symmetrically
and beautifully formed, and
with the hole partially bored on both sides.
This was probably effected with water and
sand by the tedious process of turning
round a smaller stone until the perforation
was at length completed. Tried therefore
by the standard of value of the Stone
Period, the hammer was perhaps a more
costly deposit in the tomb of some favourite
chief than the golden armillæ of later
times. The Danish antiquaries are familiar
with examples of unfinished stone
implements, and also with a still more curious class, consisting of
broken hammers and otherwise mutilated instruments, which have
been perforated with another hole or ground to a new edge, affording
striking evidence of the value of such implements to their primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
owners. The example figured here, partaking of the characteristics
both of the hammer and axe, was dug up on the farm of Dell, in the
parish of Abernethy, and is engraved from a sketch by the late
Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, Bart. It measures eight inches in length,
and was found at a depth of
about five feet from the surface,
in a soil consisting of
two feet of mould lying above
peat moss.</p>

<p>The following class of objects
includes a variety of
stone implements the uses of
which are extremely doubtful
or altogether unknown, though they are often found along with other
relics of the Stone Period. The woodcut represents various examples
of perforated stone balls, such as are frequently met with, and to
which it may be convenient to apply the name of <i>Bead-stones</i>. Some
of them are decorated with a variety of incised lines, and may have
been worn as marks of distinction or as personal ornaments held
in great esteem, as they are not uncommon among the relics deposited
in the cist or cinerary urn. One plausible theory of their use which
has been suggested is that they are the stone weights used with the
distaff, and they have accordingly received in Germany the name of
<i>Spindelstein</i>. The Scottish <i>whorle</i>, or
fly of the spinning-rock, however, is
still familiar to us, and bears only a very
partial resemblance to these perforated
balls; consisting generally of a flattened
disc, much better adapted for the motion
required in the distaff. But independently of this, these rude ornaments
have been found alongside of male skeletons, and in such numbers
as might rather induce the belief that they had formed the collar
of honour of some old barbarian chief, esteemed as no less honourable
than the golden links of rue and thistle worn by the knights of
St. Andrew at the court of the Scottish Jameses. As such, therefore,
they should be classed with the personal ornaments of the same
period, but their use is still open to question, and they may therefore
meanwhile not unfitly rank with the other objects treated of in this
chapter.</p>

<p>On demolishing a cairn at Dalpatrick, in Lanarkshire, a few years
ago, it was found to cover a cist inclosing an urn, and in the surrounding
heap were discovered another urn about six inches high, a smaller
vessel of baked clay, and a curious whinstone of roundish form, about
four inches in diameter, and perforated with a circular hole.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> "In
one of the Orkney graves," says Barry, "was found a metal spoon,
and a glass cup that contained two gills Scotch measure; and
in another a number of stones formed into the shape and size of
whorles, like those that were formerly used for spinning in Scotland."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
Two of these bead-stones in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries
were discovered in Dumbartonshire, along with various smaller ones,
some of them of glass and undoubtedly designed as ornaments.
Other examples are more in the form of a truncated cone, and are
referred to in a later chapter as perhaps the tablemen for a game
somewhat similar to that of draughts, and still called by the Germans
<i>Brettsteine</i>. Larger perforated stones have also been found. Mr.
Joseph Train describes several obtained in Galloway, five or six inches
in diameter, one of which, in his own possession, as black and glossy as
polished ebony, had been picked up in the ruins of an old byre, where
it had doubtless been used, according to the ideas of that country-side,
to counteract the spells of witchcraft.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Others formed of slate are
of frequent occurrence in the Portpatrick parish, Wigtonshire, and
are not unknown in other districts.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Unperforated spherical stones, generally about the size of an orange,
have been referred to along with other contents of the Scottish tumulus.
It is not always possible to distinguish these from the stone cannon
ball which continued in use even in James VI.'s reign. The circumstances
under which they occur, however, leave no room to doubt
that they ranked among the articles held in esteem by the primitive
races of Britain, ages before the chemical properties of nitre, sulphur,
and charcoal had been employed to supersede older projectile forces.
The distinction is further confirmed by their being occasionally decorated
with incised circles and other ornaments, as in the example
shewn here, found near the line of the old Roman way which runs
through Dumfriesshire on its northern course from Carlisle. Another of
highly polished flint has already been described among the remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>disclosures of a large cairn on the Moor of Glenquicken, Kirkcudbrightshire,
and two of similar form were shewn me recently as a part of
the contents of a cist opened in the course of farming operations on
the estate of Cochno, Dumbartonshire, one of which was made of
highly-polished red granite, a species of rock unknown in that district.
Similar balls occur among the relics found in the barrows of Denmark.
In the "Report addressed by the Royal
Society of Northern Antiquaries to its
British and American Members," printed
at Copenhagen in 1836, a class of primitive
objects are described under the
name of Corn Crushers. The engraving
of one of these represents a rude block
of stone flattened on the upper side. In
the centre of this is a circular cavity, into which a smooth ball of stone
has been made to fit, thereby supplying by a less efficient means the
same purpose aimed at in the querne, discovered so frequently under a
variety of shapes among the relics of various periods of early Scottish
history. The shallow circular stone troughs or mortars so often found
in Scottish burghs and weems belong to the same class. A still ruder
device consists of a pair of stones which have evidently been employed
in rubbing against each other, and it may be presumed with the same
object in view, that of bruising the grain for domestic use. They have
been occasionally noticed among the chance disclosures of the spade
or plough in Scotland, and are of common occurrence in the Irish
bogs. The author of the Account of Halkirk Parish, Caithness,
thus describes the mortars above referred to, and also the pestles
or crushers&mdash;manifestly a similar device to the Danish corn crushers&mdash;which
are found together in the burghs:&mdash;"I have seen in them
numbers of small round hard stones, in the form of a very flat
or oblate sphere, of 2&frac12; inches thick in the centre, and about four
inches in diameter; also other round stones, perfectly circular, very
plain and level on one side, with a small rise at the circumference,
and about a foot in diameter. The intention of both these kinds of
stones manifestly was to break and grind their grain."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> It may reasonably
be assumed, however, that neither the old British nor Scandinavian
warrior deposited under the barrow of his chief, and alongside
of his well-proved celt and spear, the homely corn crusher with which
his wives or his slaves were wont to prepare the grain for domestic
use. The decoration traceable on some of the stone balls confirms
this idea; and it is more probable they were employed as weapons of
war, like the <i>pogamoggon</i> of the Chippeway and Shoshonee Indians of
America, some of which consisted of a spherical stone, weighing from
half a pound to two pounds. This they inclosed in leather, and attached
to a thong a yard and a half in length, which was wound round
the wrist, the more effectually to secure its hold.  Along with these
objects may also be noted the roughly-shaped spherical discs of flint
occasionally found with other stone relics in Scotland, and much more
common in Ireland, where they bear the name of "Sling Stones."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 547px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>Like other of the more remarkable primitive relics, the spherical
stones have been associated with popular superstitions of a later
period, and have been esteemed, along with crystal-beads, adder-stones,
or waterworn perforated pebbles, and the like efficient armory
of vulgar credulity, as invaluable amulets or charms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The stone arrow-heads," says Pennant, "of the old inhabitants of this island,
are supposed to be weapons shot by fairies at cattle, to which are attributed any
disorders they have. In order to effect a cure, the cow is to be touched by an elf-shot,
or made to drink the water in which one has been dipped. The same virtue
is said to be found in the crystal gems and in the adder-stone; and it is also believed
that good fortune must attend the owner; so, for that reason, the first is
called <i>Clach Bhuai</i>, or the powerful stone. Captain Archibald Campbell showed me
one, a spheroid set in silver, for the use of which people came above a hundred
miles, and brought the water it was to be dipt in with them; for without that in
human cases it was believed to have no effect."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> That such was no modern superstition
he conceives is proved by a variety of evidence, as where Montfaucon remarks
that it was customary in early times to deposit crystal balls in urns or
sepulchres: thus twenty were found at Rome in an alabastrine urn, and one was
discovered in 1653 at Tournai, in the tomb of Childeric, King of France, who died
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 480.</p></div>

<p>It appears to be only natural to the uninstructed mind to associate
objects which it cannot explain with some mysterious and superhuman
end; and hence the superseded implements of a long extinct race become
the charms and talismans of their superstitious successors.</p>

<p>One other class of primitive relics remains to be noted, belonging
to the same early period. These are the ornaments, weapons, and
tools of horn or bone; such as the lances or harpoons already described
as found alongside of the stranded whales in the alluvial valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Forth. Such relics are by no means rare, notwithstanding the perishable
nature of the material of which they are constructed. Barry
describes among the contents of the Orkney tumuli, "swords made
of the bone of a large fish, and also daggers."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The woodcut represents
what should perhaps be regarded as a bone dagger. It was
found in a stone cist near Kirkwall, lying beside a rude urn, and is
now in the possession of Dr. Traill. It measures 7&frac12; inches long, and
appears to be made of the
outer half of the lower portion
of the right metatarsal
bone of an ox. The notches
cut on it are perhaps designed
to give a firmer hold, while they also serve the purpose of
rude attempts at ornament. Their effect, however, is greatly to
weaken the weapon and render it liable to break. The cross may
perhaps suggest to some the associations of a later period, but
little importance can be attached to so simple and obvious a means
of decoration. Possibly indeed so far from its affording any indication
of the influence of "the faith of the cross," it should be regarded
like the incised patterns hereafter alluded to, wrought on later bronze
implements, as suggestive of the use of the poisoned blade by the
rude aborigines of the Stone Period. Pennant has engraved an implement
of horn, carved and perforated at the thick end, found in
a large urn under a cairn in Banffshire, and another, closely corresponding
to it, was discovered in 1829, in a large urn dug up in the
progress of the works requisite for erecting the Dean Bridge at Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
A curious relic of the same class was brought to light on
removing part of a remarkable cairn which still stands, though in
ruins, on the summit of one of the Ochil Hills, on the northern
boundary of Orwell parish, Kinross-shire. It bears the name of
Cairn-a-vain, and an ancient traditional rhyme thus refers to a treasure
believed to be contained in it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the Dryburn well, beneath a stane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll find the key o' Cairn-a-vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That will mak' a' Scotland rich ane by ane.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 617px;">
<img src="images/image141.jpg" width="617" height="143" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Many hundreds of cart-loads of stones have been carried off by the
proprietor from this gigantic pile, for the purpose of building fences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>but no treasure has yet been found, though eagerly expected by the
workmen. A rude stone cist occupied the centre of the pile, within
which lay an urn full of bones and charcoal, and amongst these a
small implement of bone, about four inches long, very much resembling
in figure a cricket-bat notched on the edges.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Various weapons of horn and bone are preserved in the Scottish
collection, some of them so slender as to be rather pins or bodkins
than lances. One of the latter, measuring four inches in length, and
perforated at the broad end, was found in the year 1786, in the ruins
of one of those ancient buildings in Caithness, popularly but perhaps
not erroneously styled "Picts' houses." Alongside of it lay one of
the rings of jet or shale, which are also among the more common
relics found in Scottish barrows. To these instances may be added the
frequent occurrence of deer's horns among the contents of tumuli, not
seldom bearing similar marks of artificial cutting. Some years since a
quantity of deer's horns which had been sawn asunder were discovered
in a bed of charcoal, a few feet below the surface, outside the "Seamhill
moat," in the parish of West Kilbride, Ayrshire.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> A deer's horn
of unusually large size, and from which the brow-antler has been cut off,
is now in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries. It was obtained with
others, on levelling a large sepulchral barrow in the neighbourhood of
Elphinstone Tower, East-Lothian. Another of smaller dimensions, in
the same collection, was discovered in a cist at Cockenzie, in the same
county. Pennant mentions the similar discovery of a deer's horn, "the
symbol of the favourite amusement of the deceased," lying beside the
skeleton, in a stone cist, on the demolition of a cairn at Craigmills,
Banffshire; and on opening the most conspicuous of a group of tumuli,
in the parish of Alvie, Inverness-shire, a human skeleton was observed
entire, with a pair of large hart's horns laid across it.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> To these
instances may be added the recent discovery of ancient oaken coffins
on the Castlehill of Edinburgh, at a depth of twenty-five feet from
the surface,&mdash;more particularly described in a later chapter,&mdash;alongside
which lay a deer's skull and horns of unusually large proportions.</p>

<p>Examples of this use of the antlers of the deer are by no means rare.
It appears to offer some additional corroboration of the date assigned
to those simpler rites of sepulture, which it has been suggested may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>probably indicate an era prior to the introduction of the small stone cist
and the practice of interment in a sitting or folded posture; that in
several examples which have been carefully noted, the body has been
found laid at full length, and in one or two instances with the spreading
antlers at the feet, like the sculptured lion or stag which reposes
on the altar-tomb of our medieval chantries at the feet of the recumbent
Christian knight.</p>

<p>It cannot admit of doubt that bone and horn continued to supply
the absence of metallic weapons to the very close of the Stone Period.
Nevertheless it suggests the probable antiquity of the examples referred
to, that notwithstanding the great susceptibility of the material
for receiving ornament, they present so few of those incised decorations
common not only on the sepulchral pottery, but on the pateræ,
bead-stones, and other relics formed of the hardest materials.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 633px;">
<img src="images/image143.jpg" width="633" height="249" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting recent discoveries of this primitive class
of implements was made by Mr. G. Petrie, during his exploration of a
subterranean dwelling or weem at Skara, in the Bay of Scales, Sandwich.
A large accumulation of ashes, bones of domestic animals, the
tusks of a very large wild boar, scales of fish, &amp;c., indicated the refuse of
many repasts of its aboriginal occupants; and alongside of it, apparently
in coeval rubbish, was found a stone cist, containing, among
other remains, about two dozen oyster shells, each perforated with a
hole large enough to admit the finger. Perchance they supplied to
their simple owner a collar not less esteemed than the most coveted
orders of a modern peer. A curious variety of bone implements were
discovered at the same time. The larger of the two objects in the
annexed woodcut represents
a pin or bodkin,
formed from the left metatarsal
bone of an ox of small
size, in which the natural
form of the joint has been
turned to account for forming
its head. It measures
5-3/10 inches long. The smaller object is also of bone. One side of the
head is broken away, but the perforation has not been in the centre;
it measures 3&frac12; inches in length. Others of the tools are still more
simple&mdash;mere flat pieces of bone, roughly rubbed to an edge, and
indicating the merest rudiments of art and contrivance. Two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
examples from the same hoard are represented here, the smallest
another pin, 2&#x2158; inches long, formed from the lower end of the metatarsal
bone of a sheep, and the larger, perhaps intended as the handle
of some implement of delicate structure. It appears to be fashioned
from the metatarsal or metacarpal bone of a lamb, and is notched
with a rude attempt at ornament, which, however, as in the dagger
formerly described, must have greatly impaired its strength.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Along
with these were also found
a number of circular discs of
slate, about half an inch
thick, roughly chipped into
shape, and about the size of
a common dessert plate. The
most ready idea that can be formed of them is, that they were actually
designed for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>These simple relics of the primitive period may not inaptly recall
to us the evidences of another class of occupants of the old
Caledonian forests. At the very era when the Briton had to arm
himself with such imperfect weapons, the wolf was one of his most
common foes. Long after the era of the Roman invasion the wild
boar was a favourite object of the chase, though the huge Bos Primigenius,
whose fossil remains are so frequently found in our mosses
and marl pits, had then made way for the Bos Longifrons, (rarely
accompanying relics of a later era than the Anglo-Roman period,) and
the Urus Scoticus, or Caledonian bull, which still forms so singularly
interesting an occupant of the ancient forest of Cadzow, Lanarkshire.
The large tusks frequently found among later alluvial deposits attest
the enormous size attained by the Caledonian boar; and its repeated
occurrence on the sculptured legionary tablets of Antoninus' wall may
show that it was pre-eminent among the wild occupants of the forests
which then skirted the Roman vallum in the carse of Falkirk, and
along the slopes of the Campsie hills; if, indeed, this was not the reason
of its adoption as the symbol of the Twentieth Legion. On constructing
a new road a few years since, along the southern side of the rock on
which Edinburgh Castle stands, deer's horns and boars' tusks of the
largest dimensions were found; and in an ancient service-book of the
monastery of Holyrood, the ground which some of the oldest buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the Scottish capital have occupied for many centuries, is described
as "ane gret forest, full of hartis, hyndis, toddis, and sic like manner
of beistis." Thus is it with all that is venerable&mdash;an older still precedes
it; and the docile student, when, by searching, he has found out all
attainable knowledge, still sees behind him as before him an unknown,
undiminished by all he has recovered. Meanwhile, it seems to become
manifest, that the more minutely we investigate the primitive Scottish
era, the further it recedes into the past, and approaches to the period
of the first dispersion of the human family amid the strange confusion
of tongues; if not indeed to that still earlier time when the sons of
Javan were born after the flood, and by these were the isles of the
Gentiles divided in their lands&mdash;thus leading our thoughts, as Sir
Thomas Browne quaintly, but devoutly expresses it, "unto old things
and considerations of times before us, when even living men were
antiquities, when the living might exceed the dead, and to depart
this world could not be properly said, <i>abiit ad plures</i>, to go unto the
greater number; and to run up our thoughts upon the <i>Ancient of</i>
<i>Days</i>, the antiquary's truest object, unto whom the eldest parcels are
young, and earth itself an infant."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_158_158" id="Footnote_158_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> I have retained the name of stone celt,
notwithstanding its rejection by Mr. Worsaae
and his intelligent English editor, in
the "Primeval Antiquities of Denmark applied
to the illustration of similar remains
in England." The advantage of a fixed terminology
cannot be overestimated; but in
this case the term is of great value in order
to distinguish a peculiar class of stone implements
more frequently found in Scotland
and Ireland than the stone or flint
hatchet, and to which the British antiquary
has special grounds for applying it. Both
Owen and Spurrel give, as the meaning of the
ancient Cambro-British <i>celt</i>, a flint stone.
I propose, therefore, to retain it in what
is obviously its primary acceptation, applying
the name of bronze celt to the metal
weapon afterwards substituted for it.</p></div>

<p>A great variety of stone vessels, of different forms and sizes, have
been found in Scotland under different circumstances, but in nearly
all of them the rudeness of the attempts at ornament, and the whole
form and character, suggest the probability of their belonging to the
earliest period, coeval with the stone celt and hammer, and the bone
and flint spears of the Scottish aborigines. Even sepulchral urns of
this durable material are not uncommon, especially in the northern
and western isles. Wallace thus describes one found in the island of
Stronsa:&mdash;"It was a whole round stone like a barrel, hollow within,
sharp edged at the top, having the bottom joined like the bottom of
a barrel. On the mouth was a round stone."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> From the engraving
which accompanies this description it may be more correctly
compared in form to a common flower-pot, decorated with a series of
parallel lines running at intervals round it. In the Museum of the
Society of Antiquaries of London there are two rude stone urns, believed
to be the same exhibited to the Society by Captain James
Veitch in 1822, which were discovered on the demolition of a cairn in
the island of Uyea, Shetland, along with many similar urns, mostly
broken, and all containing bones and ashes. They are formed of
<i>Lapis ollaris</i>, and are described by Mr. Albert Way, in his valuable
Catalogue of the Society's Collection, as two rudely-fashioned vessels
of stone, or small cists, of irregular quadrangular form, one of them
having a large aperture at the bottom, closed by a piece of stone,
fitted in with a groove, but easily displaced. The other has a triangular
aperture on one side, and is perforated with several smaller
holes regularly arranged. The dimensions of the larger are about 9&frac12;
inches by 4, and the other 7 inches by 3&frac12;. Dr. Hibbert refers to
another of the same class, but probably of superior workmanship,
which he saw on his visit to the Island of Uyea. It was found along
with various other urns, which he simply mentions as of an interesting
description, and is noted as "a well-shaped vessel, that had
been apparently constructed of a soft magnesian stone of the nature
of the <i>Lapis ollaris</i>. The bottom of the urn had been wrought in a
separate piece, and was fitted to it by means of a circular groove.
When found it was filled with bones partly consumed by fire."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> A
fragment of another such urn in the Scottish Museum is described by
the donor as part of a vase of a steatitic kind of rock, found in 1829
within a kistvaen on the island of Uyea, one of the most northern of
the Zetland group. At an earlier period the opening of a barrow in
the island of Eigg exposed to view
a large sepulchral urn containing
human bones. It is described as
consisting of a large round stone,
which had been hollowed, with the
top covered with a thin flag-stone,
and was found in a tumulus which
tradition assigned as the burial-place
of St. Donnan, the patron
saint of the isle.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The singular stone
urn figured here, from the original in the Museum of the Royal Irish
Academy, is believed to have been brought from the Hill of Nowth, in
the county of Meath, one of the most remarkable chambered cairns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>yet discovered. The urn is decorated with chevron ornaments, and
figures supposed to represent the sun and moon. It is not to be imagined
that, unless in some very rare and remarkable examples, cinerary
urns thus laboriously hewn out of stone can belong to a period anterior
to the use of those formed of the plastic clay. In so far, however, as
we may judge from the few examples yet noted, they seem to be the
work of a very remote era, when such were the rare and distinguished
honours reserved perchance alone for the Arch-Druid, or high-priest of
the unknown faith, whose strange rites were once celebrated within
the <i>Taoursanan</i>, or mournful circles.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Another, and much more common Scottish stone vessel, consists of a
small round cup or bowl, with a
perforated handle on one side,
and generally measuring from
five to six inches in diameter.
Most of them are more or less
ornamented, though generally in
an extremely rude style; and
they have been found made of
all varieties of stone, from the
soft camstone to the hardest
porphyry and granite. The name by which these singular vessels
have been generally designated among Scottish antiquaries, is that of
Druidical pateræ; though if we are to assume the idea that they were
used in the sacred rites of Pagan worship, they more nearly resemble
the form of the Roman patella, than of the sacrificial patera, with
which libations were poured out to the gods.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 585px;">
<img src="images/image148.jpg" width="585" height="414" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Stone Pateræ</p></div>
</div>

<p>In several instances these singular vessels have been found in the
immediate vicinity of the so-called Druidical circles. In 1828 two
of them were discovered under an ancient causeway leading from a
circle of standing stones on Donside, in the parish of Tullynessle,
Aberdeenshire. One of these, the handle of which is imperfect, is
now deposited in the Scottish Museum, along with various other
similar examples found in different parts of Scotland. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
had a handle about nine inches long carved out of the same stone,
and terminating with a knob at the end. A similar relic was found
some time before, when clearing out the area of another stone circle
on the farm of Whiteside, in the same county. The frequency of
their occurrence, indeed, would suggest their construction for more
common use than the worship of the gods, were we not led to assume
their designation for some special object, from the very great labour
employed in making them.</p>

<p>Some of the rarer forms of the stone vessels found in Scotland are
much more suggestive of domestic purposes. One in my own possession,
found in Glen Tilt, is neatly formed in native green marble,
with two handles, not unlike the
more modern Scottish quech. Another,
in the Scottish Collection,
found in Atholl, looks like a stone
soup-ladle; and a third, of oblong
form, as shewn here, measuring
12 by 8&frac12; inches, was found at
Brough, in Shetland, in excavating
the area of one of the large circular buildings of un-cemented
stone, styled Pech's Burghs. It can hardly be more fitly described
than as a stone tureen with handles carved at either end. Others
met with under similar circumstances are wide and shallow, and
nearly resemble the large stone
basins figured here, found in the
chambers of the celebrated cairn
of Newgrange, in the neighbourhood
of Drogheda.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 626px;">
<img src="images/image149a.jpg" width="626" height="342" alt="" />

<img src="images/image149b.jpg" width="600" height="514" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Stone Basin, Newgrange.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that
these vessels, thus laboriously hewn
or wrought out of stone, should be
most frequently found either in the
neighbourhood of the rude monolithic
structures, or of other apparently
contemporary works of the earliest period. The very imperfect
nature of many of their decorations, however, suffice to prove
that they are the work of men destitute of efficient metallic tools, and
who were little likely to attempt the hopeless task of hewing the
giant columns of their temples into artificial forms. Many of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
vessels, indeed, notwithstanding the attempts at decoration visible
upon them, exhibit much less symmetry or finished workmanship
even than the stone hammers and axes of the same period. So
far as I am aware, the Druidical
patera, so frequently found in
Scotland, is peculiar to it, no similar
vessel having been discovered
among the primitive remains either
of England or Ireland. In the remoter
districts of Scotland these
ancient vessels were regarded till
recently with the same superstitious
awe and dread which we
have already seen attached to other
unfamiliar relics of the same remote era. Mr. Colin M'Kenzie, in describing
the antiquities of the island of Lewis, from personal observations
made towards the close of last century, remarks in reference
to the group of standing stones at Classernish, on the west side of
that island, with its remarkable large central stone, surrounded by a
deep hollow which retains the rain water:&mdash;"Were a ditch cut
across the circle to a tolerable depth, some utensils, ashes, &amp;c. might
be found to throw more light on the subject. I have been told that
a stone bowl was found, and afterwards thrown, through a superstitious
dread, into the hollow round of the central stone."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 542px;">
<img src="images/image150.jpg" width="542" height="469" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Stone Basin, Newgrange.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With this class may also be reckoned the Scottish querne, unquestionably
an invention of the remotest antiquity, though it has continued
in use down almost to our own day in some of the western isles and
other rarely visited Highland districts. A curious allusion to it occurs
in the Life of St. Columba, illustrative of its daily use for the preparation
of grain for bread. When the Saint studied under St. Finnian,
every night on which it fell to his share to grind the corn with the
querne he did it so expeditiously that his companions alleged he had
always the assistance of an angel in turning the stone, and envied him
accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> At that period, that is in the early part of the sixth
century, there can be little doubt that it was the only mill in use.
Even so early as the thirteenth century legal means were employed
to compel the people to abandon it for the large water-mills then introduced.
In 1284, in the reign of Alexander III., it was provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>that "na man sall presume to grind quheit, maishlock, or rye with
hands mylne, except he be compelled be storm, or be lack of mills,
quhilk sould grind the samen. And in this case, gif a man grinds at
hand mylnes, he sall gif the threttein measure as multer; and gif anie
man contraveins this our prohibition, he sall tine his hand mylnes
perpetuallie." The prevalence of these simple domestic utensils in
the remoter districts of Scotland till the close of the last century
proves how ineffectual this law had been in superseding the querne
by the public mill.</p>

<p>The commonest form consists simply of two thin circular flat stones,
the upper one of which is pierced in the centre, and revolves on a
wooden or metal pin inserted in the under one. The upper stone is
also occasionally decorated with various ornaments, incised or in relief.
In using the querne the grinder dropped the grain into the central hole
with one hand, while with the other he made the upper stone revolve
by means of a stick inserted in a small hole near the edge.
The extreme simplicity of this indispensable piece of household
furniture justifies its reference to remote antiquity. It has been already
observed that it frequently occurs among the contents of the
Scottish weems, or cyclopean underground dwellings of a very primitive
state of society. It has also been dug up under a variety of circumstances,
all furnishing probable evidence of great antiquity. One
upper stone of a querne, now preserved in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries, was discovered in 1825, along with the remains of an
iron sword, in digging on the summit of a hill called the Camp, near
Pitlour House, Fifeshire. Another in the same collection, of still
ruder form, was found built into the masonry of an ancient wall of
Edinburgh Castle, demolished in 1828.</p>

<p>One type, in which the upper stone is funnel-shaped, with radiating
grooves from the centre perforation, is believed to be the portable hand
mill of the Roman soldier. It is engraved as such in Stuart's Caledonia
Romana, <i>Plate</i> XIII.; and the only one of the same kind in the
Scottish Museum seems to corroborate this, in so far as it was found
to the south-west of Camelon, on the line of the great wall of Antoninus
Pius. It exhibits, as might be expected, more regularity and
method in its construction, and is surrounded with an iron band, now
greatly corroded, with a loop or ear, to which the handle was attached
for turning it.</p>

<p>We shall not, probably, greatly err in assuming as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
earliest types of the Scottish hand-mill, the rudely fashioned oaken
querne already referred to, which was dug up from a depth of nearly
five feet in the Blair-Drummond Moss. It is simply the section of an
oak tree, measuring nineteen inches in height by fourteen inches in diameter.
The centre has been hollowed out to a depth of about a foot, so
as to form a rude oaken mortar; and in this, with the help of a stone
or wooden pestle, its primitive possessor was doubtless wont to bruise
and pound the grain preparatory to its conversion into food. The
circumstances under which the Blair-Drummond querne was found,
when compared with the other discoveries in the same locality, scarcely
permit us to escape the inference that in it we possess a domestic
utensil contemporary with the ancient canoes of the Forth and Clyde,
if not with the stranded whales, and the rude harpoons of the carse
land from which it was disinterred.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 601px;">
<img src="images/image152.jpg" width="601" height="424" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A more artificial, though very ancient form of hand-mill, is what is
called the Pot Querne, consisting of a hollowed stone basin, with an
aperture through which the meal or flour escapes, and a smaller circular
stone fitting into it, and pierced, as in the simpler topstones,
with a hole in the centre, through which the grain was thrown into
the mill. The woodcut represents
one of unusually large
size, found on the farm of
Westbank, Gladsmuir parish,
East-Lothian, and now in the
Scottish Museum. It is made
of coarse pudding-stone, and
measures 17 inches in diameter,
and 8&frac12; inches high. It
appears to have had two handles
attached to it at opposite sides, as the holes in which they
were inserted still remain. The iron ring now fastened to it is
a modern addition of its last possessor, who used it for securing
his horse at the farm-house door. Pot quernes are common in
Ireland, though somewhat differing in form from the Scottish examples.
They are generally much smaller and shallower than the
one described above, and are made with three, or sometimes four
feet. They have likewise a cavity in the centre of the under stone,
into which the upper one fits by a corresponding projection, so as to
preclude the necessity for a metal axis. They are called by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
native Irish <i>Cloch a vrone</i>. It is from the word <i>vro</i> or <i>bro</i>, Gaelic <i>bra</i>,
(the <i>v</i> and <i>b</i> in the Irish being commutable,) signifying grindings or
bruised grain, that our Scottish word <i>brose</i> is derived, rather than
from the French <i>brouet</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, pottage or broth, though both are probably
traceable to a common Celtic root.</p>

<p>Irish pot quernes have been frequently found at great depths
in the bogs, under circumstances indicating a very remote antiquity,
though they have scarcely yet fallen into total disuse in some of
the remotest districts of the west. Dr. Petrie incidentally furnishes
a curious evidence of the antiquity of the querne. He has in his
possession the topstone of one of these primitive hand-mills, which
appears to have been converted to the unlikely purpose of a tombstone
after its original use had been lost sight of. It has been elaborately
decorated with sculptured ornaments, part of which are effaced
to make way for the name of <i>Sechnasach</i>, which its learned owner
conceives is probably the "Priest of Durrow," whose death is recorded
in Mageoghegan's translation of the Annals of Clonmacnoise at the
year 928, and in the Annals of the Four Masters at the year 931.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

PERSONAL ORNAMENTS.</h3>


<p>There only remain to be noted the earliest traces of luxury and
personal adornment contemporary with the rude weapons and implements,
and the simple habitations of earth or unhewn stone, described
in the previous chapters. These are scarcely less abundant than the
implements of war and the chase; and some of them possess a peculiar
value for us, as presenting the sole surviving memorials of female
influence, and of the position woman held in the primitive social state
which we desire to trace out as the true and rudimentary chronological
beginning of our island history. There must necessarily be some
uncertainty in any attempt to assign to the two sexes their just share
of the personal ornaments found in the early tumuli, or discovered in
the course of disturbing the uncultivated soil. Man, in such a primitive
state as we have abundant grounds for believing the Caledonian
aborigines of the Stone Period to have been, delights in assuming to
himself the personal ornaments with which, in a more advanced stage
of social life, he finds a higher gratification in adorning woman. It
should not, therefore, excite surprise when we find ornaments which
modern civilisation resigns entirely to the fair sex, such as bracelets,
hair-pins, neck ornaments, and the like, mingling with the sword and
the spear of the rude barbarian chief. Still, there are some ornaments,
and especially bead necklaces, bracelets, and some of the smaller and
more delicate armillæ, which we can hardly err in classing among
female decorations. The subject, however, is well deserving of further
attention, and the more so, as the evidence which is available in the
case of sepulchral remains is of so satisfactory and decisive a character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
when reported on by competent witnesses. There can be no doubt,
from the disclosures of numerous tumuli and cists, that the dead were
frequently buried "in their habits as they lived," and with all their
most prized personal adornments upon them, though time has made
sad havoc of their funeral pomp, and scarcely allows a glimpse even
of the naked skeleton that crumbles into dust under our gaze.</p>

<p>The rudest class of personal ornaments which are found in the sepulchral
mounds, or in the safer chance depository of the bogs, are those
formed of bone or horn; but they are necessarily of rare occurrence,
not only from the remoteness of the period to which we conceive them
to belong, but from the frail nature of the material in which they have
been wrought, which, when deposited among the memorials of the
dead, yields to decay not greatly less rapid than the remains it should
adorn, and crumbles to dust when restored to light and air. Still
some few of these fragile relics have been preserved, consisting of perforated
beads of bone, horn pins, perforated animals' teeth, and other
equally rude fragments of necklaces or pendants; but very few of them
present much attempt at artificial decoration by means of incised ornaments
or carving, such as is found to have been so extensively practised
in a later age. One curious set of bone ornaments in the Scottish
Museum includes a piece of ivory pierced with a square perforation,
and another with a nut or button fitting into it, the clasp or fibula it
may be of some robe of honour worn by a chief of the ancient race.</p>

<p>Ornaments of jet or shale and cannel coal, and large beads of glass
and pebble, are of much more frequent occurrence in the Scottish grave-mounds,
and furnish extremely interesting and varied evidence of the
decorative arts of these remote ages. Many of them, however, are
found under circumstances which leave no room to doubt that they
belong to a period coeval with the introduction of metals, and the skill
acquired in the practice of the metallurgic arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 591px;">
<img src="images/image156.jpg" width="591" height="321" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is another class of relics, however, which we can feel no hesitation
in ranking among the earliest remains of the Stone Period,
though it may sometimes be difficult to determine whether we should
regard them as mere personal ornaments or as charms employed in the
mysterious rites of Pagan superstition, as it is not uncommon to find
them used, at a very recent date, by their illiterate inheritors in some
of the remoter districts of the Highlands and Isles. One relic, for
example, in the Scottish Museum, consists of a flat reddish stone,
roughly polished. It measures 4 inches in length, and about 2&frac34; inches
in its greatest breadth, and is notched in a regular form, with two
holes perforated through it. It was presented to the Society of
Scottish Antiquaries in 1784, as a charm in use among the population
of the island of Islay for the cure of diseases. From its correspondence
with others of the earliest class of relics, it can hardly
admit of a doubt that it belongs to the personal ornaments of the
Stone Period, and may have owed the reverence of its more recent
possessor to the fact of its discovery within some primitive cist, or in
the charmed circle of Taoursanan, the origin of which is commonly
ascribed to superhuman powers. It is worthy of note, indeed, that
the word <i>Druidheachd</i> is no longer associated with the priesthood of
the British groves, but is now only used by the Scottish Highlanders as
applicable to sorcery or magic. Another, but much less perfect ornament
of perforated reddish stone, in the same collection with the above,
was found, along with several flint arrow-heads, in the island of Harris;
and a third, still ruder, was discovered, with a similar arrow-head, on
the Lomond Hills of Fifeshire. But perhaps the most singular relics
of the Stone Period ever discovered in Scotland are two stone collars,
found near the celebrated Parallel Roads of Glenroy, and now preserved
at the mansion of Tonley, Aberdeenshire. They are each of the full
size of a collar adapted to a small Highland horse; the one formed
of trap or whinstone, and the other of a fine-grained red granite.
They are not, however, to be regarded as the primitive substitutes for
the more convenient materials of later introduction. On the contrary,
a close imitation of the details of a horse collar of common materials is
attempted, including the folds of the leather, nails, buckles, and holes
for tying particular parts together. They are finished with much care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and a high degree of polish, and are described as obviously the workmanship
of a skilful artist. Mr. Skene, who first drew attention to
these remarkable relics, suggests the probability of the peculiar natural
features of Glenroy having led to the selection of this amphitheatre
for the scene of ancient public games; and that these stone collars
might commemorate the victor in the chariot race, as the tripods still
existing record the victor in the Choragic games of Athens. But no
circumstances attending their discovery are known which could aid
conjecture either as to the period or purpose of their construction.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1832, a large tumulus, on the shore of Broadford Bay,
Isle of Skye, was levelled in the progress of some improvements on the
estate of Corry, and it was found to cover a rudely vaulted chamber,
within which lay a cist inclosing a human skeleton, along with
various bones of animals, the species of which were not ascertained.
Alongside of the skeleton an ornament of polished pale green stone
was discovered, measuring about 2&frac12; inches in length, by 2 inches in
breadth. Its form will be best understood by the
annexed woodcut. It is convex on the upper side,
and concave on the under side, with a small hole
drilled at each of the four corners, and an ornamental
border of slightly indented ovals along one
end. It differs only in dimensions from another
previously referred to, in the collection of Adam
Arbuthnot, Esq., of Peterhead, which was obtained
from a tumulus at Cruden, Aberdeenshire.
It measures 4&frac14; inches in length. Another ornament
of polished green stone was afterwards discovered in the neighbourhood
of the tumulus at Broadford Bay. It measures about 3&frac12;
inches in length, and nearly an inch in breadth at the centre, but
tapers to about half an inch in breadth at either end, where a
small hole is drilled through. It is only a fifth of an inch in thickness.
Simple as are the forms of both of these relics, they represent a class
which appear to have been common
among the personal decorations of
the Stone Period, whether regarded
merely as ornaments, or valued for
some hidden virtue which may
have been supposed to pertain to them. A sepulchral deposit, closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
corresponding to that found in the Isle of Skye, was discovered by some
labourers employed in sinking a ditch at Tring, in Hertfordshire, about
the year 1763. The relics were entirely of the same rude primitive
class, and it furnished an example in confirmation of previous remarks
regarding the earliest sepulchral rites, as the skeleton was found laid at
full length, with legs and arms extended. Between the legs lay some
flint arrow-heads, and at the feet ornaments resembling, both in form
and material, those found in the tumulus at Broadford Bay.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Sir R.
C. Hoare describes objects of similar character, found in the barrows of
Wiltshire, some of which were made of blue slate;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and small perforated
plates of stone or flint, of slightly varying forms, are not uncommon
among the contents of the earlier British tumuli. They are not,
however, confined to Britain. Simple as are the forms of the two
relics figured above, there is a sufficiently marked character about
them to excite our surprise when we meet with them in the grave of
the ancient native of Skye, and in the cists of Herts or Wiltshire;
but ornaments of almost exactly the same forms have been discovered
in the mounds of the great valley of the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> accompanied with
celts, stone hatchets, and other primitive implements closely resembling
those of the British Stone Period; though also with many
more so essentially differing, as to forbid us deducing from such chance
coincidences any fanciful community of origin between the Allophylian
colonists of Europe and the aborigines of America.</p>

<p>Still ruder are the primitive necklaces, formed of the common small
shells of our coasts, such as the <i>Nerita litoralis</i>, and even the <i>Patella</i>
<i>vulgata</i>, or common limpet, perforated, apparently, by the simple
process of rubbing the point on a stone, and then strung together with
a fibre or sinew. It may perhaps be thought by some that sufficient
space has already been devoted to this infantile period of the race, yet
childish as such decorations seem, they are found among the valued
relics of men whose giant monuments have outlived many massive
structures destined by later ages to perpetuate the memory of historic
deeds, or consecrated to the services of the all-powerful Church of
medieval Christendom. Underneath the cromlech discovered on
levelling a tumulus in the Ph&#339;nix Park at Dublin, in 1838, two male
skeletons were disclosed, and beside the skull of each lay the perforated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>shells of a necklace which had doubtless been placed around their
necks when they were deposited in the simple but grand mausoleum
that still attests the veneration of the ancient natives for their chiefs.
A portion of the vegetable fibre with which they had been strung together
remained through some of the shells, and the only other relics
found in the grave were a small fibula of bone, and a knife or lance-head
of flint. The common British bivalves are also found used for
similar decorations. In a cist discovered on the coast of the Frith of
Forth, during the construction of the Edinburgh and Granton Railway,
the only relics deposited beside the skeleton which it enclosed were a
quantity of the <i>cardium commune</i>, or cockle, of different sizes, rubbed
down until they were reduced nearly to rings; while in another cist,
opened at Orkney, and more particularly referred to in a previous
chapter, about two dozen oyster shells were discovered, each perforated
with a hole nearly an inch in diameter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

CRANIA OF THE TUMULI.</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding the zeal with which English archæologists have
pursued their investigations among the remains of primitive sepulchral
deposits, scarcely anything has yet been done towards obtaining
a collection of facts in relation to the size and form of the
skulls, and the general characteristics of the skeletons of their constructors.
In this, as in so many other respects, the archæologists of
Sweden and Denmark have set us an example well deserving of imitation,
and have shewn the essential dependence of Archæology on the
kindred sciences, with which it has heretofore failed to effect a hearty
alliance in Britain. Had Sir Richard Colt Hoare examined the osteology
of the tumuli of Wiltshire with the same patient accuracy and
precision which he devoted to their archæology, a most important
basis would have been furnished for ethnological research. Now,
however, that such investigations are recognised as coming within the
legitimate scope of archæological inquiry, we may hope ere long to
ascertain by such evidence somewhat of the characteristics of the
aboriginal race of the Stone Period, and also to obtain an answer to
the inquiry,&mdash;Was the Bronze Period superinduced on the Primeval
one by internal improvement and progression, or was it the result
of the intruded arts of a superior race? This, it is manifest, can only
be determined by an extensive series of observations, since physiologists
are generally agreed in admitting that the physical characteristics
of races have been largely modified, and even entirely altered, by
a change of circumstances. The nomadic Turkish tribes, for example,
spread through central Asia, still exhibit the broad-faced, pyramidal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
skulls which Dr. Prichard has assigned to the nomadic races, while
the long civilized European Turks have become closely assimilated to
other European races, and possess the characteristic oval skull.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> "The
greater relative development of the jaws and zygomata, and of the
bones of the face altogether, in comparison with the size of the brain,
indicates, in the pyramidal and prognathous skulls, a more ample
extension of the organs subservient to sensation and the animal faculties.
Such a configuration is adapted, by its results, to the condition
of human tribes in the nomadic state, and in that of savage hunters."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
Two important points, therefore, which remain to be determined in
relation to the British tumuli are, whether the forms and proportions
of the skulls of their builders indicate the existence of one or of several
races? and next, whether the changes in the forms of the crania
are sudden and decided, or are gradual, and pass by an undefined
transition from the one to the other? It will be found in the succeeding
section that archæological evidence clearly points to a transitional
state from the Stone to the Bronze Period, such as is at least
altogether irreconcilable with the idea of the sudden extermination
of the aboriginal race. It at the same time no less distinctly points
to the existence of a native population in Britain long anterior to
the earliest historic indications of the Arian nations passing into
Europe.</p>

<p>To these early races, which we describe loosely as primitive, or as
aboriginal or primeval, Dr. Prichard has suggested the application of
the conveniently indefinite term "Allophylian," which suffices to
characterize them as distinct from the well ascertained primitive races,
without meanwhile assuming any hypothetical origin for them. It
remains to be seen whether the archæologist may not be able to supply,
in a great degree, the desired information in relation to the habits,
arts, and social condition of these unknown races:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Allophylian nations," Dr. Prichard remarks, "appear to have been spread,
in the earliest times, through all the most remote regions of the old continent,&mdash;to
the northward, eastward, and westward of the Indo-European tribes, whom they
seem everywhere to have preceded; so that they appear, in comparison with these
Indo-European colonies, in the light of aboriginal or native inhabitants, vanquished,
and often banished into remote and inaccessible tracts, by more powerful invading
tribes. The latter, namely, the Indo-European nations, seem to have been everywhere
superior in mental endowments. Some tribes, indeed, had retained or ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>quired
many characteristics of barbarism and ferocity; but with all these they joined
undoubted marks of an earlier intellectual development, particularly a higher culture
of language as an instrument of thought, as well as of human intercourse. If
we inquire into the degree of improvement in the arts of life which the Indo-European
nations had attained at the era of dispersion from their primitive abode,
or from the common centre of the whole stock, an investigation of their languages
will be our principal guide. It gives us strong grounds for a belief that their advancement
in useful arts had been comparatively small. The primitive ancestors of
the Indo-European nations were probably ignorant of the use of iron and other metals,
<i>since the terms by which these are denoted are different in different languages, and must,</i>
<i>as it would appear, have been adopted subsequently to the era of separation</i>. Nothing
can be more unlike than <i>gold</i>, &#967;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#962;, and aurum; than <i>silver</i> and argentum; than
<i>ferrum</i> and &#963;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;. Other considerations may be advanced to confirm this opinion,
that the use of metals was unknown to the earliest colonists of the west....
But though unskilled in many of the most useful arts of life, the Arian people
appear to have brought with them a much higher mental culture than the Allophylian
races possessed before the Arian tribes were spread among them. They had
national poetry, and a culture of language and thought altogether surprising, when
compared with their external condition and habits."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p></div>

<p>The religion which consists in mere fetisses, charms, spells, and
talismans is in like manner ascribed by Dr. Prichard to these Allophylian
nations; in contradistinction to the Eastern doctrine of metempsychosis,
with the coincident belief in a system of retributive justice,
and the distinct recognition of a future state, which appear to
have been common to all the Arian nations, and to have been further
developed by their being confided to a distinct order, caste, or priesthood.
Of the former races the modern Fins, Lappes, and Esquimaux
still remain as characteristic examples. Of the latter, the historic
Celtæ, Scandinavian and German-Teutonic races are sufficiently illustrative,
while the modern Hindoos are a living evidence of the
south-eastern migration of the same great branch of the human
family. But of the degree of civilisation of the Arian nomades when
they reached the western shores of Europe, or of the state in which
they found the countries which they colonized, we as yet know almost
nothing; and it still remains to be determined whether they entered
into peaceful possession of unpeopled wastes, or won them from primitive
Allophylian nations. On these points archæological observation
may be expected to throw some light. The irregular or systematic
arrangement of the cist, the provisions for the future occupation
and welfare of the deceased, and all the peculiarities of primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
sepulchral rites, more or less clearly indicate the arts and habits of
those by whom they were practised, and still more, the ideas entertained
by them in relation to a future state.</p>

<p>Of the Allophylian colonists of Scandinavia, Professor Nillson assigns
to the most ancient the short or brachy-kephalic form of cranium,
with prominent parietal tubers, and broad and flattened occiput. To
this aboriginal race he conceives succeeds another with a cranium of a
more lengthened oval form and prominent and narrow occiput. The
third race, which Scandinavian antiquaries incline to regard as that of
the bronze or first metallic period, is characterized by a cranium longer
than the first and broader than the second, and marked by greater
prominence at the sides. The last Professor Nillson considers to have
been of Celtic origin. To this succeeded the true Scandinavian race,
and the first workers of the native iron ore.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Professor Eschricht
assigns to the crania from the barrows of the oldest Danish series
an ample and well-developed form, with the forehead vaulted and
tolerably spacious, and the nasal bones prominent. In a skull described
by him the zygomata appear large and angular, and the
cranium has somewhat of a pyramidal form. The eyes have been
deeply set, and the eyebrows are strongly prominent. One of the
most remarkable features in these skulls is their round form, approaching
to a spherical shape.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>The type of the old Celtic cranium is considered by Professor Nillson
as intermediate to the lengthened and shortened oval, or the true
dolicho-kephalic and brachy-kephalic forms, and in this conclusion Dr.
Thurnam coincides. Dr. Morton describes the Celtic head as "rather
elongated, and the forehead narrow and but slightly arched; the brow
low, straight, and bushy; the eyes and hair light; the nose and mouth
large; and the cheek-bones high."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Such characteristics differ decidedly
from those of the early barrows. Dr. Prichard, however,
hesitates to accept the conclusions adopted by Scandinavian ethnologists,
attaching it may be too slight importance to the strictly archæological
evidence on which they are to some extent based. He
remarks in reference to the description of the skulls of the most
ancient Scandinavian barrows:&mdash;"They are probably the crania of
Celtic races; in Denmark of Cimbrians. The tombs containing ornaments
of the precious metals are referred to a later age; but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>uncertain as yet whether they belonged to the same race as the
former."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> One marked difference has hitherto existed between the
systems of several of the chief continental ethnologists and those of
England, which has somewhat influenced the conclusions of each.
While continental investigators into the phenomena of various races
have set aside the idea of one primitive stock,&mdash;some of them even
assuming the primal existence of numerous distinct and independent
human races,&mdash;British ethnologists, with Dr. Prichard at their head,
have held fast by the Adamic history, and in maintaining the origin
of all the races of man from one pair, have also given its full force to
the influence of external circumstances in modifying the physical
peculiarities of each race. That the progress of a people in civilisation
must be accompanied with a corresponding improvement in their
intellectual faculties and also in their physical conformation is now
generally admitted. Long time, however, is required even under
the most favourable circumstances, for any very decisive modification
affecting the form and features of a whole people, so that the
sudden intrusion of a foreign race must be no less readily discernible
from their crania than from novel arts or sepulchral rites. Nothing
has yet been done by Scottish archæologists with a view to ascertain
the physical conformation of the primitive native races; and the
small contribution now offered as a beginning, is founded on too
limited data to be of very great avail, except perhaps in opening up
the subject and leading to more extended observation. Fortunately
a few skulls from Scottish tumuli and cists are preserved in the
Museums of the Scottish Antiquaries and of the Edinburgh Phrenological
Society. A comparison of these with the specimens of crania
drawn by Dr. Thurnam from examples found in an ancient tumular
cemetery at Lamel Hill, near York, believed to be of the Anglo-Saxon
period, abundantly proves an essential difference of races.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The latter,
though belonging to the superior or dolicho-kephalic type, are small,
very poorly developed, low and narrow in the forehead, and pyramidal
in form. A striking feature of one type of crania from the Scottish
barrows is a square compact form. Though full in the middle-head,
these are by no means deficient in the forehead; but it will
be observed from the first class of examples in the following table of
measurements, that they are generally of small relative size,&mdash;a fact
which has been frequently noted, even by casual observers, when see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ing
them <i>in situ</i>, and contrasting their dimensions with the disproportionate
size of the skeleton. The system of measurement employed
in the following table is chiefly that adopted by Dr. Morton in his
"Crania Americana," and the terms are used in the sense explained
by him under the head "Anatomical Measurements," (p. <a href="#Page_249">249</a>.) From
the fractured and very fragile state of many of the skulls, it was impossible
to attempt the measurement of their internal capacity by the
ingenious process employed by Dr. Morton. The last column in the
table is accordingly found by adding the longitudinal and vertical diameters
and the horizontal periphery. This is not assumed as affording
any test of the actual capacity of each cranium, but only as a fair relative
approximation and element of comparison. Owing to the undetermined
form of the processes in several of the crania and the imperfection
or total absence of the facial bones, from their greatly decayed
state, the additional measurements marked * are given as less liable
to error. Some of them, such as the inter-mastoid arch and inter-mastoid
line, taken from the upper root of the zygomatic process instead
of from the points of the mastoid processes, are also, perhaps,
preferable as more uniform and precise.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>The full value of such investigations, and even their precise bearing
and the conclusions legitimately deducible from them, may probably
be matter of dispute, but there can be no question that a general distinctive
cranial conformation is clearly discoverable in modern nations,
and is even very markedly observable between the different races of
the British Isles. Given a sufficient number of examples of each class,
the experienced eye would at once discriminate between the modern
European Fin, Germanic Teuton, and British Celt. The conclusion
appears therefore inevitable, that if we find in the ancient tumuli like
variations in physical form, systematically reducible to two or more
classes, we are justified in assuming the existence of diverse primitive
races, and of seeking in the accompanying relics for indications of
their peculiar arts and customs, as well as of their relative positions
as contemporary or successive occupants of the country.</p>

the more perfect arts of civilisation. These changes archæologists are
now agreed in associating with the introduction of iron. But if in
this latter point also the parallel be admissible, then we must less conceive
of the more perfect arts of civilisation being superinduced on
those of the Archaic Period, than of the Allophylian nations being
themselves superseded. More extended observations on the physical
characteristics of these races will probably, to a great extent, determine
this. Two skulls selected from Morton's Crania Americana are
placed at the head of the table, and will afford a very satisfactory
comparative estimate of the cranial capacity of the races of the Scottish
tumuli. No. i. is figured in <i>Plate</i> XVII. of Dr. Morton's valuable
work, from which it will be seen that it decidedly belongs to the
Brachy-kephalic class of Retzius, which again nearly corresponds with
the pyramidal division of Dr. Prichard. It is thus described by Dr.
Morton:&mdash;"With a better forehead than is usual, this skull presents
all the prominent characters of the American race&mdash;the prominent
face, elevated vertex, vertical occiput, and the great swell from the
temporal bones upward." No. ii. is figured in <i>Plate</i> XVIII. of the
same work, and closely corresponds to it in type. It is described as
"a remarkably well characterized Toltecan head from an ancient tomb
near the city of Mexico, whence it was exhumed, with a great variety
of antiques, vessels, masks, ornaments," &amp;c. These, therefore, afford
a fair comparative criterion of the capacity of the tumuli builders of
Britain for the practice of arts analogous to those in which the later
American races so greatly excelled at the epoch of the Spanish Conquest;
and it will be seen that the comparison is, upon the whole, in
favour of the superior intelligence of the British Brachy-kephalic race,
as indicated by the cerebral mass and frontal development. No. 1.
is an exceedingly interesting example of a skull of the Stone Period,
in the Antiquarian Museum. It was found in 1822 in a rude cist in
the parish of Banchory-Devenich, Aberdeenshire. On the top of the
head is a hole nearly circular, rather more than an inch in diameter,
which there can scarcely be a doubt was caused by the death-blow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
In each corner of the cist lay a small pile of flint flakes.&mdash;No. 2 was
taken from one of thirty cists found near Fifeness, in 1826, and described
in a previous chapter.&mdash;Nos. 3, 4, and 5 were obtained from
a group of rude cists discovered in the neighbourhood of Cockenzie,
East-Lothian, in 1840. Nos. 3
and 4, as well as the two previous
examples, are in the Museum
of the Scottish Antiquaries.
No. 5 has been obtained
from J. M. Mitchell, Esq., who
was present when the graves at
Cockenzie were opened, and is
here figured as a characteristic
example of the class. No relics
were found along with these remains,
but the cists were of the
primitive circumscribed dimensions,
and presented the rudest
characteristics of early sepulture.&mdash;No.
6 is a skull in the
Edinburgh Phrenological Museum
found on the farm of Stonelaws, East-Lothian, where a number
of rude primitive cists have been exposed in the course of agricultural
operations. Some of these lie east and west, with the heads at the
west end, according to Christian practice, but others are irregularly
laid; and the example here noted was found with the head at the
east end of the grave.&mdash;No. 7 was obtained from a cist discovered
under a large cairn at Nether Urquhart, Fifeshire, in 1835. An account
of the opening of several cairns and tumuli in the same district
is given by Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, in his "Inquiry respecting
the Site of the Battle of Mons Grampius."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Some of them contained
urns and burnt bones, ornaments of jet and shale, and the like
early relics, while in others were found implements or weapons of
iron. It is selected here as another example of the same class of
crania.&mdash;No. 8 was found in a cist under a tumulus opened at Newbattle,
East-Lothian, in 1782. This, there can be little doubt, was
the large encircled tumulus in the immediate vicinity of the Abbey,
which was found to cover a cist nearly seven feet long. The cranium
is well proportioned and of unusually large dimensions, and probably
pertained to a chief of gigantic stature.&mdash;No. 9 is from a tumulus at
Montrose. The whole of these, more or less, nearly agree with the
lengthened oval form described
by Professor Nillson as the second
race of the Scandinavian
tumuli. They have mostly a
singularly narrow and elongated
occiput; and with their comparatively
low and narrow forehead,
might not inaptly be described
by the familiar term
<i>boat-shaped</i>. It is probable that
further investigation will establish
this as the type of a primitive,
if not of the primeval
native race. Though they approach
in form to a superior
type, falling under the first or
Dolicho-kephalic class of Professor
Retzius' arrangement,
their capacity is generally small, and their development, for the most
part, poor; so that there is nothing in their cranial characteristics
inconsistent with such evidence as seems to assign to them the rude
arts and extremely limited knowledge of the British Stone Period.</p>

<p>No. 10 is an exceedingly characteristic example of an entirely different
type of cranium. It was obtained under very remarkable circumstances,
more particularly detailed in a subsequent chapter. On
the demolition, in 1833, of the old Town Steeple of Montrose, a
building of great antiquity, it was found that at some depth beneath
its ancient foundations there lay the sepulchres of a much more remote
period. Mr. William Smith of Montrose, remarks in a communication
sent to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1834,
along with the donation of an urn:&mdash;"The accompanying urn or vase
is one of four of the same description found about the beginning of
April 1833 below the foundation of the Old Steeple in Montrose, beside
the skeleton of a human body,&mdash;two of them being at each side
of the head, and two near the feet.... Exactly below the foundations
of the Old Steeple the skeleton was discovered, with the vases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
disposed about it as mentioned. It measured six feet in length.
The thigh bones, which were very stout, and the teeth, were the only
parts in good preservation. The skull was a little wasted, and was
given to the Rev. Mr. Liddell, of
Lady Glenorchy's Chapel, who
intended to present it to Mr.
Combe of the Phrenological Society."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
The skull, of which the
measurements are given in No.
10, is the same here referred to,
presented to the Phrenological
Museum by the Rev. Mr. Liddell.
It is a very striking example of
the British Brachy-kephalic type;
square and compact in form,
broad and short, but well balanced,
and with a good frontal
development. It no doubt pertained
to some primitive chief,
or arch-priest, sage, it may be, in
council, and brave in war. The site
of his place of sepulture has obviously
been chosen for the same
reasons which led to its selection at a later period for the erection of the
belfry and beacon-tower of the old burgh. It is the most elevated spot
in the neighbourhood, and here his cist had been laid, and the memorial
mound piled over it, which doubtless remained untouched so long
as his memory was cherished in the traditions of his people.&mdash;No. 11
was found in a moss near Kilsyth, Stirlingshire. It is nearly black,
and quite firm and sound, from the action of the peat. Its general
characteristics clearly belong to this second group, but it has been
injured in parts, and apparently subjected to great pressure, so as to
render some of the measurements doubtful.&mdash;Nos. 12 and 13 are
skulls found at different times, at a considerable depth, in a moss at
Linton, Peeblesshire.&mdash;No. 14 is a very characteristic example of the
Brachy-kephalic type of cranium. It was found in a cist under a
tumulus in the parish of Ratho, Mid-Lothian, and alongside of the
skeleton stood a small rude clay urn, within which lay several bronze
rings.&mdash;No. 15 is also a good example of the same type. It was obtained,
in 1849, from a cist partly hollowed out of the natural trap
rock on the farm of East Broadlaw, in the parish and county of
Linlithgow. It was covered with two unhewn slabs of stone, and
measured internally about six
feet long. The skeleton was in
good preservation, and lay at full
length. Only a few inches of
soil covered the slabs with which
it was inclosed. No relics were
found in the cist, but some time
prior to its discovery a bronze celt
and spear-head were turned up in
its immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Few as these examples are, they
will probably be found, on further
investigation, to belong to a race
entirely distinct from those previously
described. They correspond
very nearly to the Brachy-kephalic
crania of the supposed primeval
race of Scandinavia, described by
Professor Nillson as short, with prominent parietal tubers, and broad
and flattened occiput. In frontal development, however, they are
decidedly superior to the previous class of crania, and such evidence
as we possess seems to point to a very different succession of races
to that which Scandinavian ethnologists now recognise in the primitive
history of the north of Europe. Our data are as yet too few to
admit of our doing more than noticing these indications of the evidence
that has been produced, in the hope that it may stimulate
to the further prosecution of this interesting branch of primitive
ethnology.</p>

<p>No. 16 is a cranium chiefly interesting from the circumstances
under which it was found. During the construction of the Edinburgh
and Hawick Railway, in 1846, extensive Roman remains were
brought to light in the vicinity of the village of Newstead, Roxburghshire.
These are described in a subsequent chapter. In the
progress of the work the excavators exposed a group of circular shafts,
or well-like pits, varying from three feet to about twenty feet in depth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
They were filled with black fetid earth, intermixed with bones of
animals, Roman pottery, mortaria, amphoræ, Samian ware, &amp;c., whole
and in fragments. In one of these
shafts was found the entire skeleton
of a man, standing upright,
with a long iron spear at his side,
and various specimens of Roman
pottery in the debris with which
the pit was filled.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Of the period,
therefore, to which the cranium
belongs, there can be no doubt,
though no sufficient evidence exists
to determine whether it pertained
to a Roman legionary, or
a contemporary native Briton.
The latter is, perhaps, more probable.
The skull is of moderate
size, but exceedingly well proportioned,
the teeth are in perfect
preservation, with the crowns very little worn, and the markings of
all the muscles are unusually strong and well defined.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>No. 16. Roman Shaft, Newstead.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The succeeding group of crania, Nos. 17-27, afford a fair average
criterion of the Celtic type.&mdash;No. 17 is a skull dug up in a cave on
the sea-coast, at the Mull of Kintyre, Argyleshire, near to where tradition
affirms a battle to have been fought between the natives and
an invading host of Northmen.&mdash;No. 18 is in like manner a memorial
of Scandinavian aggression, and is marked in the catalogue of the
Phrenological Museum as the skull of a Dane. It was dug out of the
sand on the sea-beach, near Larnahinden, Argyleshire, where a party
of Danes are believed to have landed and been defeated. It exhibits
some remarkable measurements, especially in the small proportion of
the vertical diameter; and a comparison of its various dimensions
with those of the Roman skull, No. 16, brings out very distinctly
the points of disagreement of two essentially different forms of crania.
No. 18, however, is not to be accepted as a good Celtic type. The
best medium form of the Celtic cranium is No. 20, which appears, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
so far as the present amount of observation admits of such conclusions,
to be a fair standard of this important class of crania. It forms
one of a very interesting group of skulls in the Phrenological Museum.
No. 19 was brought from Harray, near Lewis, and Nos. 20-24 from
Iona. The whole of these were presented to the Society, in 1833, by
Mr. Donald Gregory, Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,
and they are each marked by him as the "Skull of a Druid from
the Hebrides." They were no doubt obtained during the operations
carried on by the members of the Iona Club, thus described in the
introduction to the Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In order to celebrate the institution of the Club, a meeting was held in the
island of Iona, upon the 7th day of September 1833, permission having been obtained
from His Grace the Duke of Argyle, the President, to make such excavations
in the island as the Club might deem necessary. A search was made in the
ancient cemetery called <i>Relig Oran</i>, for such tombstones as might in the process
of time have been concealed by the accumulation of rubbish. The result of these
operations was, that a considerable number of finely carved tombstones was brought
to view, which none of the inhabitants had ever seen before."</p></div>

<p>The sepulchres of the Scottish kings were also explored, which were
used for the last time as a royal cemetery when Macbeth was interred
there beside his Queen Gruoch, the daughter of Bodhe,&mdash;as a record
in the St. Andrew's Chartulary informs us was the unromantic name
of Lady Macbeth.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Mr. Donald Gregory was secretary of the Iona
Club, and one of the ablest Celtic scholars of his day. The designation
which he affixed to the crania brought from Iona may be accepted
as undoubted evidence of their having been found under circumstances
which afforded proof of their high antiquity; though it is not necessary
to assume from this that they had pertained to Druids. Most
probably nothing more was intended by the epithet which Mr. Gregory
applied to them, than to indicate, in the briefest manner, that
he believed them to have belonged to the native population prior to
the introduction of Christianity in the sixth century, when Columba
landed at <i>Innis nan Druidheanach</i>, or the Isle of the Druids, as Iona
is still occasionally styled by the native Highlander. The crania
thus brought from the venerable centre of Celtic civilisation may
not unreasonably be looked upon as furnishing characteristic types
of the oldest historical race of the north of Europe.&mdash;No. 25 is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>a good Celtic cranium, though less true to the type than No. 20,
from its excess in longitudinal diameter. It was dug up at Knockstanger,
Caithness, at a spot where a number of the Clan Mackay
were interred, after being defeated in a battle fought with the Sinclairs
in 1437. To these have been added No. 26, a skull in the
Phrenological Museum, brought from an ancient cemetery at Inchmore,
or Columb Kill, county of Longford, Ireland; and No. 27, a cast
of a skull in the Phrenological Museum, marked as the Celtic type,
and described as one of a series of skulls "selected from a number of
the same tribe or nation, so as to present, as nearly as possible, a type
of the whole in the Society's collection."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> It is characterized in the
printed catalogue as a "Long Celtic Skull," but would not, I think,
be accepted by ethnologists as at all typical of the true Celtic cranium.
It falls decidedly under the class designated by Professor Retzius as
Dolicho-kephalæ, and is introduced in the table of measurements
chiefly as furnishing useful elements of comparison. Contrasted with
No. 20, it will be seen that it is 7.11 to 7.5, exceeding the latter in
longitudinal diameter by 6/12, or half an inch, while in parietal diameter
it falls short of it by 3/24. The difference is equally in favour of
the true Celtic cranium, No. 20, in other measurements of breadth,
including the frontal diameter and the inter-mastoid arch. This mode
of comparison is still more remarkable and characteristic when the
same skull, No. 27, is placed alongside of No. 10, a good example of
the Brachy-kephalic class, the excess in the one set of measurements
being fully balanced by a corresponding diminution in the
others. The proportions of these Scottish Celtic crania entirely agree
with the assumed type already referred to, as recognised by the ablest
ethnologists. Professors Nillson and Retzius, and Dr. Thurnam, all
concur in describing the type of the old Celtic cranium as intermediate
to the true Dolicho-kephalic and Brachy-kephalic forms. Dr.
Norton Shaw also recognises the same characteristic proportions, and
refers in evidence to a skull in the museum of Dr. Buckland, which
was found in a tin mine in Cornwall at a depth of 500 feet.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Returning to the table of measurements.&mdash;No. 28 is a skull in the
Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries. It was found in what appears
to have been an ancient tumular cemetery, at North-Berwick, East-Lothian,
from whence also a specimen of early medieval pottery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>figured in a later chapter, was procured. Many ancient relics have
been obtained at the same place, including a circular silver fibula,
apparently of the Anglo-Saxon era. A large surrounding area appears
to have been used as a burial ground, probably for many centuries, as
the encroachments of the sea frequently expose human bones, and the
skeletons may be occasionally discerned in the newly exposed strata,
after an unusually high tide.&mdash;Nos. 29 and 30 are crania in the Phrenological
Museum from the same locality. Of these No. 29 is a markedly
inferior example of cranial development. While all the measurements
are small, the frontal diameter is inferior to that of No. 12, the
smallest of all the Brachy-kephalic examples, which it exceeds in
longitudinal diameter by half an inch. So extremely poor is the
frontal development of this skull, that its diameter at the zygomatic
processes is barely 3.5&frac12;. It is only introduced here in order to afford
a series of examples selected without any reference to theory.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 644px;">
<img src="images/image175.jpg" width="644" height="553" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Tower in the Vennel, Edinburgh.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The remaining skulls with which these are classed may be regarded
as a fair series of examples of medieval Scottish crania.&mdash;No. 31 was
found in 1828, in a deep cutting about midway up the south side of
the rock on which Edinburgh Castle stands, during the construction
of a new approach to the old town. Beside it were several large boars'
tusks, and an iron weapon greatly corroded.&mdash;No. 32 was obtained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
1829, in digging the foundations of a school built in the Vennel of
Edinburgh, on the site of part of the town wall, erected immediately
after the disastrous battle of Flodden in 1513. The woodcut represents
the ancient tower, which still remains, almost the last remnant
of the civic fortifications reared at that memorable crisis in Scottish
history, and the relic which is here associated with these venerable
defences is not without features appropriate to the stern memorials of
that epoch. The skull has a deep gash, apparently from the blow of
a sword or axe, and pertained, we may presume, to some old civic
warder of the Scottish capital, slain at his post on the city wall.&mdash;Nos.
33-38 were all discovered in the course of excavations made to
the south of the old Parliament House at Edinburgh in 1844, for
the purpose of building new court-houses, when several ancient oak
coffins and other early relics were brought to light.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> They lay alongside
of the earliest city wall, built by James III. in 1450, and within
the Nether Kirkyard of St. Giles', which appears to have fallen into
disuse in the reign of Queen Mary. To these are added No. 39, a
skull found in digging a drain in Constitution Street, Leith, probably
within the ancient limits of St. Mary's Church-yard, which was
bounded on that side by the ancient town wall, razed to the ground
immediately after the siege of Leith in 1560. These crania, it should
be added, are apparently all males, with the exception of No. 4, and
perhaps also No. 36.</p>

<p>Such are the elements from which it has been attempted to deduce
some conclusions of general import in regard to the successive primitive
races that have occupied Scotland prior to the era of authentic
historic records. The data are much too few to justify the dogmatic
assertion of any general inferences, or to admit of positive answers to
the questions naturally suggested by the conclusions arrived at by
Nillson and Eschricht in relation to the races of Scandinavia. They
include, however, all the examples that could be obtained, and are in
so far valuable as trustworthy examples of the cranial characteristics
of Scottish races, that they have been selected from various localities,
by different individuals, with no single purpose in view. It is difficult,
however, even after obtaining the proper crania, to determine the
most trustworthy elements of relative proportion. Dr. Walter Adam,
who had the advantage of studying under both Dr. Barclay and Mr.
Abernethy, carried out an extensive series of measurements of crania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
chiefly from examples found in the catacombs of Paris, and preserved
in the University Museum there. These I now possess, through the
kindness of Dr. Adam, and he remarks in writing to me on the subject:&mdash;"So
far as appeared, precision could only be obtained by referring
every dimension to the compression of the zygoma; the measurement
being seven-eighths of what I consider the normal transverse
of at least the Caucasian cranium; that is, of half the length of the
head&mdash;the long-admitted statuary scale." Owing to the imperfect
state of the zygomata in the great majority of skulls from the tumuli,
this measurement is unfortunately rarely attainable. Next in importance,
however, is one of the additional ones in the table, marked
as the inter-mastoid line, from the upper root of the zygomatic process.
The relative proportions of this and of the parietal diameter,
when compared with the longitudinal diameter, afford the most characteristic
elements of comparison between the different types. Another
interesting element of comparison appears to consist in the
relative proportions of the parietal and vertical diameters. So far as
appears from the table of measurements, the following laws would
seem to be indicated:&mdash;In the primitive or elongated dolicho-kephalic
type&mdash;for which the distinctive title of kumbe-kephalic is here suggested&mdash;the
parietal diameter is remarkably small, being frequently
exceeded by the vertical diameter; in the second or brachy-kephalic
class, the parietal diameter is the greater of the two; in the Celtic
crania they are nearly equal; and in the medieval or true dolicho-kephalic
heads, the parietal diameter is again found decidedly in
excess; while the preponderance or deficiency of the longitudinal in
its relative proportion to the other diameters, furnishes the most
characteristic features referred to in the classification of the kumbe-kephalic,
brachy-kephalic, Celtic, and dolicho-kephalic types. Not
the least interesting indications which these results afford, both to the
ethnologist and the archæologist, are the evidences of native primitive
races in Scotland prior to the intrusion of the Celtæ; and also the
probability of these races having succeeded each other in a different
order from the primitive colonists of Scandinavia. Of the former fact,
viz., the existence of primitive races prior to the Celtæ, I think no
doubt can now be entertained. Of the order of their succession, and
their exact share in the changes and progressive development of the
native arts which the archæologist detects, we still stand in need of further
proof; and the assumed primeval position of the kumbe-kephalic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
race of Scotland is advanced here only interrogatively, and with the
view of inducing others to take up the same interesting inquiry. The
subject demands much more extended observation before any such
conclusion can be dogmatically affirmed concerning the primitive
Scottish races. We have also still to obtain the proofs of that abrupt
change from the one form to the other, only to be procured as the
result of numerous independent observations, but which can alone
satisfactorily establish the fact of the intrusion of new races. The
same evidence may also be expected to show whether the primitive
race was entirely superseded by later colonists. If the Allophylian
aborigines were not exterminated, but were admitted to share in the
superior arts of their conquerors, some proof may yet be recoverable
of the gradual progression in physical conformation as they abandoned
the nomadic and wild hunter state for a pastoral life, so that
they were not finally extirpated, but interfused into the mixed race
which now occupies the country, as we know was to some extent the
case, at a later period, with its Celtic population.</p>

<p>Not only in the annual operations of the agriculturist, but also in
the deliberate researches of the archæologist, hundreds of tumular
crania have been disinterred. Of these, however, scarcely any note
has been taken, nor can we hope to obtain sufficient data for the determination
of the interesting questions involved in the investigation
till its importance is more generally recognised. A few facts, however,
have been noted from time to time, some of which, in the absence
of more precise observations, may help to throw light on the physical
characteristics of the primitive British races. With this view, therefore,
the following additional notices are selected.</p>

<p>In 1825 one of the singular northern circular forts usually styled
burghs, situated at Burghar, in the parish of Evie, Orkney, was explored
by the son of the resident clergyman, when there was found
within the area a human skeleton, a rude bone comb of most primitive
fashion, and part of a deer's horn. The comb, which is now preserved
in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, is figured in another
chapter; it measures four inches in length, and could not readily
be surpassed in the rudeness of its construction or attempts at ornament.
Along with this curious relic, the skull was forwarded to Edinburgh
by Alexander Peterkin, Esq., but it is described in his communication
as then in fragments, and has not been preserved. Mr.
Peterkin remarks of it,&mdash;"Although the upper part of the skull be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
separated into two parts, you will observe on joining them together
that it is of a very singular conformation. The extreme lowness
of the forehead and length backward, present a peculiarity which
may be interesting to phrenologists."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> This, therefore, would appear
to have belonged to the primitive Kumbekephalæ.</p>

<p>Other observations on the physical characteristics of the remains
found in primitive Scottish sepulchres are much less definite. Alexander
Thomson, Esq. of Banchory, remarks in a communication to
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, describing two urns found in
a cist on his estate in Aberdeenshire:&mdash;"The skeleton was far from
entire, but there were fragments of every part of it found. The teeth
are perfectly fresh, and from the appearance of the jaws, the skeleton
must be that of a full-grown person, though of small size. I was told
that the skeleton lay quite regular when first found."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> It may be
presumed that in this case, as in other examples of the physical conformation
of the primitive race, the smallness of the head was not a precise
criterion of the dimensions of the skeleton. Another correspondent
describes a cist discovered by the plough on the farm of Farrochie, in
the parish of Feteress, Kincardineshire, within which was found a small
urn and upwards of one hundred beads of polished black shale:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The interior of the tomb measured three feet in length, two feet in breadth,
and twenty inches in depth. The top, sides, and ends were each formed of one
stone, and at each corner the end of a flat-stone, set on its edge, was introduced
angularly between the stones of the sides and ends. The slab that formed the
cover of the tomb measured three feet eight inches in length, by three feet two
inches in breadth. The body had been laid upon its right side, with the face towards
the south. The limbs had been bent upwards, and it was observed when the
tomb was opened that one of the leg bones had been broken near the middle. The
length of the leg bones was eighteen inches, and that of the thigh bones twenty
inches, with very strong joints. The skull appeared to be small in proportion to
the other parts of the body. In both jaws the teeth were complete and in beautiful
preservation. The ribs and other small bones crumbled into dust soon after they
were exposed to the air. The urn was lying in the tomb as if it had been folded
in the arms of the corpse."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Prichard remarks in reply to the question,&mdash;Was there anything peculiar
in the conformation of the head in the British or Gaulish races? "There are probably
in existence sufficient means for deciding this inquiry in the skulls found in
old British cairns or places of sepulture. I have seen about half a dozen skulls
found in different parts of England, in situations which rendered it highly probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>that they belonged to ancient Britons. All these partook of one striking characteristic,
viz., a remarkable narrowness of the forehead compared with the occiput,
giving a very small space to the anterior lobes of the brain, and allowing room for
a large development of the posterior lobes. There are some modern English and
Welsh heads to be seen of a similar form, but they are not numerous."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></div>

<p>The crania already noticed from the Scottish tumuli, it is obvious,
include two greatly differing types, one of which, at least, cannot
with strict propriety be described as either remarkably narrow or
very small in the forehead, when compared with the occiput. The
description of Dr. Prichard will, however, be frequently found applicable
to those of the brachy-kephalic type, examples of which, it may
be presumed, have fallen under his notice. The peculiar characteristic
of the primeval Scottish type appears rather to be a narrow prolongation
of the occiput in the region of the cerebellum, suggesting
the term already applied to them of <i>boat-shaped</i>, and for which the
name of <i>Kumbekephalæ</i> may perhaps be conveniently employed to
distinguish them from the higher type with which they are otherwise
apt to be confounded. Dr. Thurnam remarks,&mdash;"The few
crania which I have myself seen from early British tumuli, correspond
very much with Dr. Prichard's description. They had, for
the most part, a shortened oval form; ample behind, and somewhat
narrow and receding in the forehead. The cranium from the undoubtedly
British tumulus at Gristhorpe, near Scarborough, has this
general form; it is, however, unusually large, and not deficient in
frontal development; its form, too, is in some respects fine, particularly
as regards the full <i>supra-orbital</i> region, and the high and fully
developed middle head."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The Rev. Abner W. Brown, vicar of Pitchley,
Northamptonshire, furnished to the Archæological Association in
1846 an interesting account of some British Kistvaens found there
under very remarkable circumstances. The name of the locality is
spelt in Doomsday-book <i>Pihtes-lea</i> and <i>Picts-lei</i>, terms sufficiently
suggestive of the Celtic Picts or Ffichti of the north. "The skeleton
which we have endeavoured to preserve," the writer remarks, "is that
of a muscular well-proportioned young man, probably five feet nine
inches high. The teeth are fine; the wisdom teeth scarcely developed.
The facial line in some of the skulls appeared to be very fine. This
skull exhibits the peculiar lengthy form, the prominent and high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>cheek-bones, and the remarkable narrowness of forehead which characterize
the Celtic races, and distinguish theirs from the rounder,
broader skulls, and more upright facial line, of the Teutonic tribes."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
It is obvious, however, from the above description, that the ancient
crania of Pihtes-lea differ greatly from the true Celtic type, and
correspond rather to the Kumbekephalæ. The whole circumstances
attendant on their discovery indicate their belonging to a very remote
era. The venerable church of Pitchley, an edifice still retaining
original work of the beginning of the twelfth century, having begun
to exhibit alarming symptoms of decrepitude, was carefully repaired
and restored, even to the foundations. In reconstructing one of the
principal pillars, the startling fact was brought to light, that the
Norman builders had laid the foundation of the pillar in ignorance
of a rude hollow cist lying directly underneath, with only about
a foot of soil between. Other portions of the edifice were discovered
to have been, in like manner, unconsciously founded above the graves
of an elder race, and it at length became apparent that the ancient
churchyard was entirely superimposed on a still older cemetery.
"Below the foundation, though above the level of the kistvaens, there
were common graves; in one of them was the skeleton of a beheaded
person lying at full length, the head placed upon the breast, one of
the neck-bones having apparently been divided." Pitchley Church
belonged, even before the Conquest, to the Abbey of Peterborough.
It was probably one of the earliest English sites of a Christian church;
yet the British or Saxon graves of the upper tier, made in ignorance
of the older cists below, had become sufficiently consolidated at the
date of the Norman foundation to admit of the building of a solid
and durable fabric above them. The cists lay nearly east and west,
the bodies at full length, lying on their right sides, with the faces
looking to the south, and the arms crossed in a peculiar way&mdash;the
right arm across the breast, with its hand touching the left shoulder,
and the left arm straight across, so that its hand touched the right
elbow.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Both Norman and Roman coins were found near the surface;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>deeper down lay fragments of coarse unglazed British and also of
Roman pottery, and close to, or within one of the cists, a rude oblong
amethyst, about an inch long, perforated lengthwise. In another
were small pieces of charcoal, and a fragment of British pottery; and
in a third an unusually large tusk of a wild boar. Mr. Brown,
conceiving the position of the bodies to prove the introduction of
Christian sepulchral rites, supposes these cists to have belonged to
the Christians of Romanized Britain, before the Saxon invasion. It
seems more probable that they pertain to that far older era which
preceded the singular Pagan rites accompanying the circumscribed
cist. The cranial characteristics appear to confirm this idea, and it is
only on such a supposition that we can conceive of the establishment
of the graveyard upon the site, in entire ignorance of the primeval
cemetery buried beneath the accumulated debris of later generations.
Another skeleton, found near Maidstone, in a circumscribed cist of
peculiar construction, and undoubtedly of Pagan origin, is thus described
by the Rev. Beal Post:&mdash;"The state of the skull, from the
sutures being much obliterated, shewed the individual to have been
about seventy years of age; the form of the skull also shewed that
he did not belong to the present race which possess the island, but to
the Celtic division of the European family. It was very narrow in
the front part, and low in the forehead, exhibiting but little development
of the intellectual faculties, while the organs of self-preservation,
and other inferior organs in the hinder parts of the skull, were strongly
developed. The bones seem to be those of a person about five feet
seven inches high, the thigh-bone being seventeen inches long, and
the other bones in proportion. The teeth, apparently, had been every
one in a sound state. None of those found were in a state of decay,
even incipiently so."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In both of these interesting examples it is obvious
that the term Celtic is loosely applied in contradistinction to
Saxon or Teutonic, and in accordance with the preconceived idea
that the Celtæ are the primeval colonists of Britain. The forms of
these crania appear clearly to lead to a different conclusion. Such
are some of the observations heretofore made on the physical characteristics
of the primitive Briton. Scanty as they are, they possess
considerable value to us in the attempt to recover the lost chapters of
his history. Imperfect as the development of the intellectual faculties
appear to have been, there is sufficient evidence to justify the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>clusion,
that the races of the tumuli, whether regarded as Allophylian
or Celtic, were abundantly capable of civilisation, and possessed a
cerebral capacity fully equal to that of nations which have carried the
practical and decorative arts far in advance of a mere archaic period.</p>

<p>One characteristic feature observed in the skulls of various tumuli
is the state of the teeth. It is rare to find among them any symptoms
of irregularity or decay. Sir R. C. Hoare remarks of those of Wiltshire,&mdash;"The
singular beauty of the teeth has often attracted our
attention; we have seldom found one unsound or one missing, except
in the cases of apparent old age. This peculiarity may be easily accounted
for. The Britons led a pastoral life, feeding upon the milk
of their flocks and the venison of their forests; and the sweets of the
West Indies were to them totally unknown." In the tumular cemetery
at North Berwick, the teeth of the skulls, though sound, were
worn, in most cases completely flat, like those of a ruminating animal.
Dr. Thurnam remarks the same to have been the case with the
teeth examined by him in those of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at
Lamel Hill; and it is also observable in an under jaw found along
with other remains of a human skull, an iron hatchet, and several
large boars' tusks, in a deep excavation on the south bank of the
Castlehill of Edinburgh. The jaw, with the accompanying relics, are
in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries. The same peculiarity is
referred to, as observed in a remarkable discovery of human remains
in the Kent's Hole Cave, near Torquay, made by the late Rev. J. MacEnery
during his geological researches in that locality. As the account
of this discovery, which is accompanied with details of great value to the
archæologist, has only been recovered through the zeal of Mr. Edward
Vivian, since the death of the author, and printed in a local periodical,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
it is extracted here at considerable length. It was to Mr.
MacEnery's researches that Buckland and others of the earlier modern
geologists owed their most valuable data; and some of the rarest
palæontological specimens in the British Museum originally belonged
to his private collection. Kent's Hole is referred to by Professor
Owen, in his History of British Fossil Mammals, as "perhaps the
richest cave depository of bears hitherto found in England." The
roof is clustered with pendant cones of stalactite, and the floor thickly
paved with concretions of stalagmite, the accumulations of many centuries,
which have sealed down the floor hermetically, and preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>the relics both of the geologist and the archæologist safe from disturbance,
and protected from decay.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The floor we found, at our first visit, covered, through its whole extent, with a
darkish mould, varying in depth from a few inches to a foot. It only dates since
the cavern became a popular place of resort, and the further progress of the stalagmite
in open situations was interrupted by the trampling of visitors. In the vestibule
were found, deep imbedded in it, those curiously shaped pieces of oak to which
the appellation of Druids' sandal was given,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> together with a quantity of decomposed
animal and vegetable matter, the remains of fires and feasts, mingled with
rabbit bones....</p>

<p>"At the hazard of unnecessarily charging the thread of my narrative with seemingly
frivolous particulars, I proceed to note down the characters presented by its
general aspect, no less than its contents, before it was altered by those operations
which have since left no part of it in its virgin state. It is only on a just appreciation
of all their circumstances that a true estimate can be founded of those facts
which should serve as the basis of all reasoning on its nature and history.</p>

<p>"The floor of the entrance, except that it had the appearance of being broken
up, offered nothing remarkable to detain us; we shall have occasion to return to
it presently. Not so the lateral branch by which it communicates with the body
of the cavern on the left. Under a ledge on the left was found the usual sprinkling
of modern bones, and, in the mould beneath, which had acquired the consistence of
hard clay, were fragments of pottery, calcined bones, charcoal, and ashes; in the
midst of all were dispersed arrow-heads of flint and chert. The ashes furnished a
large proportion of the mould.</p>

<p>"In the same heap were discovered round slabs of roofing slate of a plate-like
form, some crushed, others entire. The pottery is of the rudest description, made
of coarse gritty earth, not turned on a lathe, and sunbaked; on its external margin
it bears zigzag indentations, not unlike those represented on the urns found by Sir
Richard Hoare in the barrows of Wiltshire. These fragments, there seems no reason
for doubting, are the remains of cinerary urns which once contained the substances
scattered around, and to which the slates served for covers.</p>

<p>"At a short distance, nearer the entrance, were found, in a continuation of the
same mould, articles of bone of three sorts; some of an inch long, and pointed at
one end, or arrow-heads; others about three inches long, rounded, slender, and
likewise pointed. Conjecture was long busy as to their destination&mdash;they were
thought by some to be bodkins, by others for confining the hair, like those ornaments
used by the women in Italy; lastly, they were supposed, with more probability,
to be a species of pin for fastening the skin in front which served savages
for garments. The third article does not seem so easy to explain; it is of a different
shape, quite flat, broad at one end, pointed at the other, the broad part
retains the truncated form of a comb, the teeth of which were broken off near their
root; whether it was used as a comb, or for making nets for fishing, is not clear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>There was only this solitary one found, and two of the former, but several of the
first, with a quantity of bone chips. All three bore marks of polish.</p>

<p>"Nearer the mouth are collected a good number of shells of the muscle, limpet,
and oyster, with a palate of the scarus. This, as well as the nacker of oysters which
was thickly disseminated through the mould, served, as they do at the present day
among savages, most probably for ornament. The shell-fish may have furnished
bait for fishing. The presence of these rude articles render it probable that they
were collected here by the ancient aborigines, who divided their time between the
chase and fishing in the adjacent sea.</p>

<p>"Close to the opposite wall, in the same passage, buried in black mould, I
found a stone hatchet, or celt, of sienite, the only one found in the cavern. Another
of the same material, but of a different shape, I found shortly after not far from the
cavern near Anstis Cove, which labourers engaged in making the new cut had just
thrown up with the mould.</p>

<p>"As we advanced towards the second mouth, on the same level, were found,
though sparingly, pieces of pottery. The most remarkable product of this gallery
were round pieces of blue slate, about an inch and a-half in diameter and a quarter
thick. They may have served, like the Kimmeridge coal, for money. In the same
quarter were likewise found several round pieces of sandstone grit, about the form
and size of a dollar, but thicker and rounded at the edge, and in the centre pierced
with a hole, by means of which they seem to have been strung together like beads.
Clusters of small pipes or icicles of spar, such as depended from the roof at our first
visit, we saw collected here in heaps, buried in the mud. Similar collections we
had occasion to observe accompanied by charcoal, throughout the entire range of
the cavern, sometimes in pits excavated in the stalagmite. Copper ore&mdash;with these
various articles in the same stuff was picked up&mdash;a lump much oxydized, which the
late Mr. Phillips analyzed, was found to be pure virgin ore.</p>

<p>"Having taken a general survey of the surface of the floor, we returned to the
point from which we set out, viz., the common passage, for the purpose of piercing
into the materials below the mould. Here in sinking a foot into the soil, (for of
stalagmite there remained only the broken edges adhering to the sides of the passage,
and which appeared to be repeated at intervals,) we came upon flints in all
forms, confusedly disseminated through the earth, and intermixed with fossil and
human bones, the whole slightly agglutinated together by calcareous matter derived
from the roof. My collection possesses an example of this aggregation in a mass
consisting of pebbles, clay, and bone, in the midst of which is imbedded a fine blade
of flint, all united together by sparry cement.</p>

<p>"The flints were in all conditions; from the rounded pebble as it came out of
the chalk, to the instruments fabricated from them, as arrow and spear-heads, and
hatchets. Some of the flint blocks were chipped only on one side, such as had
probably furnished the axes, others on several faces, presenting planes corresponding
exactly to the long blades found by their side, and from which they had been evidently
sliced off; other pebbles still more angular and chipped at all points, were
no doubt those which yielded the small arrow-heads. These abounded in by far
the greatest number. Small irregular splinters, not referrible to any of the above
divisions, and which seem to have been struck off in the operation of detaching the
latter, not unlike the small chips in a sculptor's shop, were thickly scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
through the stuff, indicating that this spot was the workshop where the savage
prepared his weapons of the chase, taking advantage of its cover and the light.</p>

<p>"I have discovered in this passage precisely similar arrow-heads to those which
I detected in an urn from a barrow presented to me by the Rev. Mr. Welland.</p>

<p>"With the exception of the Boar spear [of iron] and a blade of the same metal
found not far from it, very much rusted, all the articles in the mould or in the
disturbed soil consisted of flint, chert, sienite, and bone&mdash;such primitive substances
as have been in all countries and down to the present, used by the savage for the
fabrication of his weapons, whether for the chase or battle.</p>

<p>"At a still greater depth, near the common entrance in the passage, lay extended
lengthwise in the ordinary position of burial, the remains of a human skeleton
much decayed; two portions only of the jaw and some single teeth, with the mouldering
vertebræ and ribs, were all that remained. As in the case of the flint knife
mass, already described, there adhered to the jaw portions of the soil on which it
lay, and of the stalagmite which partly covered it.</p>

<p>"The teeth were so worn down that the flat crowns of the incisors might be mistaken
for molars,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> indicating the advanced age of the individual. M. Cuvier, to
whom I submitted the fragment in 1831, was struck with the form of the jaw. He
pronounced it to belong to the Caucasian race. He promised to bestow particular
notice on it, but death, unhappily for science, put a stop to his labours. All the
specimens, together with a collection of fossil bones, the third I had presented to
the museum of the Jardin des Plantes, I transmitted to him before I quitted the
continent, and they may be found among his effects. The skeleton lay about a foot
and a half below the surface; from the tumbled state of the earth, the admixture of
flags of stalagmite, added to the presence of flint articles and pieces of slate, it was
manifest that the floor had been dug up for the reception of the body, and that it
was again covered over with the materials thrown up from the excavation. The
earthy covering consisted of the red soil, containing fossil bones mixed up with
recent mould, the mound of earth outside the mouth, at the right hand, was thrown
up from the passage to render it more accessible. It was precisely that which
covered the human skeleton, and contained the admixture of human and fossil relics.</p>

<p>"Previous to the disturbance of the floor for the admission of the body, it would
appear, from the presence of flags of stalagmite in the rubble, that it was covered
with a continuous crust, the edges indeed of which still adhere to the sides. It
further appears from the repetition of similar crusts, as indicated by the broken
edges at the sides, that there were periods of repose which allowed new floors to
form, marking clearly their repeated destruction and renovation at intervals of time.</p>

<p>"With the exception of single teeth and an occasional rib or vertebra in charcoal,
which may have possibly belonged to the same subject, there were no other traces
of human remains."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The peculiarity in the teeth of certain classes of ancient crania
above referred to is of very general application, and has been observed
as common even among British sailors. The cause is obvious, resulting
from the similarity of food in both cases. The old Briton of the
Anglo-Roman period, and the Saxon both of England and the Scottish
Lothians, had lived to a great extent on barley bread, oaten cakes,
parched peas, or the like fare, producing the same results on his teeth
as the hard sea-biscuit does on those of the British sailor. Such,
however, is not generally the case, and in no instance, indeed, to the
same extent in the skulls found in the earlier British tumuli. In
the Scottish examples described above the teeth are mostly very
perfect, and their crowns not at all worn down. In that marked
No. 5, one of those found at Cockenzie, the under jaw has been preserved,
and in it the wisdom teeth are only partially developed, indicating
the age of the individual. The perfectly formed teeth are not
much more worn than those which had never pierced the gums.</p>

<p>The inferences to be drawn from such a comparison are of considerable
value in the indications they afford of the domestic habits
and social life of a race, the last survivor of which has mouldered
underneath his green tumulus, perchance for centuries before the era
of our earliest authentic chronicles. As a means of comparison this
characteristic appearance of the teeth manifestly furnishes one means
of discriminating between an early and a still earlier, if not primeval
period, and though not in itself conclusive, it may be found of considerable
value when taken in connexion with the other and still more
obvious peculiarities of the crania of the earliest barrows. We perceive
from it, at least, that a very decided change took place in the
common food of the country, from the period when the native Briton
of the primeval period pursued the chase with the flint lance and
arrow, and the spear of deer's horn, to that comparatively recent
period when the Saxon marauders began to effect settlements and
build houses on the scenes where they had ravaged the villages of the
older British natives. The first class, we may infer, attempted little
cultivation of the soil. Improving on the precarious chances of a
mere nomadic or hunter life, we have been led to suppose, from other
evidence, that the early Briton introduced the rudiments of a pastoral
life, while yet his dwelling was only the slight circular earth-pit, in-covered
with overhanging boughs and skins. To the spoils of the chase
he would then add the milk of his flock of goats or sheep, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with no other addition than such wild esculents, mast, or fruits, as
might be gathered without labour in the glades of the neighbouring
forest. But the social state in the British Isles was a progressive one.
Whether by the gradual improvement of the aboriginal race, or by
the incursion of foreign tribes already familiar with the fruits of
agricultural labour, the wild pastoral or hunter life of the first
settlers was exchanged for one more suited to call forth the social
virtues. The increase of the population, whether by the ingress of
such new tribes, or by the numerical progression of the first settlers,
would of itself put an end to the possibility of finding subsistence by
means of the chase. Thus it might be from the inventive industry
which privations force into activity that new wants were first discovered,
new tastes were created, and satisfied by the annual harvests
of golden grain. The ploughshare and the pruning-hook divided
attention with the sword and the spear, which they could not supplant;
and the ingenious agriculturist devised his oaken querne,
his stone-rubber, or corn-crusher, and at length his simple yet
effective hand-mill, which resisted, during many centuries of change
and progress, all attempts to supersede it by more complicated machinery.
Dr. Pettigrew, in communicating the results of a series of
observations on the bones found in various English barrows, remarks,&mdash;"The
state of the teeth in all of them indicated that the people had
lived chiefly on grain and roots."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The dry, hard oaten cake of the
Scottish peasant, which may have been in use almost from the first
attempt at cultivation of the favourite national grain, would probably
prove as effective as any of the presumed vegetable foods for producing
such results. We need not, at any rate, evidence to satisfy us
that the luxuries which have rendered the services of the dentist so
indispensable to the modern Briton were altogether excluded from
the regimen of his rude forefathers.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Colt Hoare commences the great work which has
secured for him so distinguished a place among British archæologists,
with the motto&mdash;"We speak from facts, not theory." While seeking
to render the <i>facts</i> of Scottish Archæology fully available, it is my
earnest desire to follow in the footsteps of a leader so proved. The
inferences attempted to be deduced from such facts as have been accumulated
here, with a view to discover some elementary principles
for the guidance of Scottish archæologists, are such as appear natu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>rally
and logically to follow from them. Still they are stated apart
from the premises, and those who have followed thus far ungrudgingly
in exploring the primeval sepulchres of Scotland, will find no difficulty
in pausing ere they commit themselves to the same guidance in
seeking also some glimpses of the native hearth and pastoral inclosures,
and of the evidences of that inventive skill which succeeded
to such simple arts. We would fain reanimate the ashes in these
long buried urns, and interrogate the rude British patriarch regarding
a state of being which for centuries&mdash;perhaps for many ages&mdash;pertained
on these very spots where now our churches, palaces, and
our homeliest dwellings are reared, but which seems almost as inconceivable
to us as that other state of being, to which we know the
old Briton, with all the seed of Adam, has passed.</p>

<p>It may appear to some a service of little value, the unrolling of
these "mute inglorious" records. Yet somewhat is surely gained
when we reach the beginnings of things, and substitute for the
old historic mist-land of myth and fable, a coherent and intelligible,
though dry and somewhat meagre array of facts and legitimate
deductions. It is no longer needful, however, to defend the object of
our research. It is to some extent the same which the ethnologist
is pursuing by a different route; though the palæontological investigations
of the archæologist have yet to establish their true value in
the estimation of men of science by the nature of their results. For
this we wait in hope. I would only meanwhile repeat, that we cannot
be justified in concluding any knowledge which once existed to be
utterly lost beyond recall; and if the geologist has been able to recover
so much from annals that seemed to have been folded up and
laid aside ere this race was summoned into being to people a renovated
world, surely we ought not to despair of being yet able to fill
up our meagre outline with many details which shall satisfy the
severest demands of inductive philosophy, and rest their claims to
acceptance not on theory but on fact.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;INTRODUCTION OF METALS.</h3>


<p>The evidence adduced in the previous section furnishes the basis
of the argument from whence we arrive at the conclusion, that Scotland
and the whole British Isles were occupied by a human population
many ages prior to the earliest authentic historical notices.
Of the character and habits of the barbarian Briton of the primeval
period we have also been able to arrive at some knowledge. His
dwellings, the remains of which have lain unheeded around the
haunts of so many generations, shew his domestic accommodation to
have been of the simplest and most humble description. His imperfect
tools and weapons furnish no less satisfactory evidence of his
scanty knowledge, his privations, and his skill. Searching amid the
records of that debateable land to which the geologist and the antiquary
lay equal claim, we learn that vast areas of our country were
covered at that remote era with the primitive forest; that oaks of
giant height abounded where now the barren heath and peat-bog
cumber the land; and that even, at a comparatively recent period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the fierce Caledonian bull, the wolf, and the wild boar asserted their
right to the old forest-glades. The primitive Caledonian was, in fact,
an untutored savage. The race was thinly scattered along the skirts
of the continuous range of forest, occupying the coasts and river valleys,
and retreating only to the heights or the dark recesses of the
forest when the fortunes of war compelled them to give way before
some more numerous or warlike neighbouring tribe. The vast forests
which then occupied so large a portion of the soil, while they confined
the primitive inhabitants to the open country along the coasts and
estuaries, supplied them with more valuable fruits than the unoccupied
grounds could have afforded to their scanty numbers and untutored
skill. Besides the fiercer natives of the forest, we are familiar
with the remains of the elk and the rein-deer, as well as of smaller
beasts and birds of chase. In the Anglo-Saxon Ode on Athelstan's
Victory, in which&mdash;</p>

<p>we have the following curious enumeration from the old MSS. in the

<p>We are not without abundant evidence that the primitive Caledonian
waged successful war with the wild natives of the forest. By arrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sling, and lance, and also, no doubt, with help of gins and traps, the
largest and fiercest of them fell a prey to the wild hunter. The horns
especially of the deer supplied him with weapons, implements, ornaments,
and sepulchral memorials. His wants were few, his tastes
simple and barbarous, his religion probably as unspiritual as the most
base of savage creeds. In the long wanderings of his nomade fathers
across the continents of Asia and Europe, they had greatly deteriorated
from the primal dignity of the race, they had forgotten all the
heaven-taught knowledge of Eden, and had utterly lost the antediluvian
metallurgic arts. It may perhaps be asked if the annals of
so mean a race are worthy of the labour required in dragging them
to light from their long-forgotten repositories? The answer is, they
are our ancestry, even though we may question our lineal descent;
our precursors, if not our progenitors. From them we derive our in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>heritance
and birthright; nor, amid all the later mingling of races,
can we assume that no drop of their blood mingles in our veins.</p>

<p>There can be no question that this aboriginal race continued to
occupy their island home, with slow and very slight progression, for
many centuries. The disclosures of the latest alluvial deposits have
furnished evidence of the appearance which the face of the country
presented within the historic era, and leave no room to doubt that
vast forests covered so large a portion of the soil as to afford no great
area for the occupation of its aboriginal colonists. Taking into account
with this the abundance of those rude weapons and implements
from whence we give that era the name of the Stone Period, and
the general uniformity of the circumstances under which they are
discovered, we are furnished with satisfactory evidence of a thinly
peopled country, occupied by the same tribes with nearly unchanging
habits for many ages.</p>

<p>The elements, however, of a great revolution were at length introduced
among this simple race, and, as usual in the history of progressive
civilisation, they appear to have come from without. The
change by which we detect the close of the long era of barbarism,
and the introduction of a new and more advanced period, is the discovery
of the art of smelting ores, and the consequent substitution of
metallic weapons and implements for those of stone. The former presents
us with the helplessness of childhood without its promise; the
latter is the healthful infancy of a vigorous and magnificent manhood.</p>

<p>The insular position of Britain has already furnished an indisputable
and well-defined base on which to rear the argument of primitive
colonization. The valuable mineral wealth of some portions of its
soil happily supply no less satisfactory data for those of its early
civilisation. Little doubt can now be entertained that Herodotus, in
his allusions to the Cassiterides, or Tin Islands, refers to the celebrated
districts of Cornwall and the neighbouring isles, which still
abound with the same mineral wealth that conferred on them such
ancient and wide-spread fame. The era of the father of history dates
from <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 484&mdash;the year assigned as that of his birth&mdash;probably to
nearly the close of the century. At this early period, then, while the
Republic of Rome was only assuming form, and Athens was just rising
into importance, the commerce of the British Isles attracted the
navies of Tyre and Carthage; nor does it seem improbable that the
Ph&#339;nicians traded with the miners of Cornwall and the Scilly Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
at a much earlier period, if indeed we must not look to these ancient
Cassiterides as one of the chief sources from whence even the Egyptians
and Assyrians derived the tin with which they alloyed and hardened
their earliest tools. More definite, and, as it is believed, authentic
information regarding the British Isles is derived from the "Ora
Maritima" of Festus Avienus, circa <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 400, from which we learn
that Britain was visited at that early period by Carthaginian voyagers,
and that the <i>Albiones</i> occupied the larger island, while the
smaller island was possessed by the <i>Gens Hibernorum</i>. In so far as
this early writer may be relied upon, his observations appear to
sanction the conclusion that a pure Celtic population then possessed
the whole British Isles, and that it is in the interval between this
epoch and the invasion of Julius Cæsar that we must look for the intrusion
of the newer continental races, indiscriminately termed by
Cæsar, <i>Britanni</i>. In complete confirmation of this, and of the consequent
retreat of the aboriginal Albiones towards the remoter districts,
we find the name of Albion afterwards exclusively applied to
the northern part of Britain, and all the earliest traditions and writings
of both the Welsh and Scottish Celtæ assigning to them the
name of Albanich. A Celtic race, however, continued to occupy the
primeval districts of Cornwall, and preserved almost to our own day
a distinct dialect of the Celtic tongue.</p>

<p>The familiarity of the ancient Britons with tin, though this metal
does not occur in a native state, may be readily accounted for from
the ore being frequently found near the surface, and requiring only
the use of charcoal and a very moderate degree of heat to reduce it to
the state of metal. We have no specific mention of any other source
from whence the ancients derived the tin which they compounded
with the copper found so abundantly in several parts of Asia; with
the single and somewhat vague exception made by Strabo, where he
calls a certain place in the country of the Drangi, in Asia, by the
name of Cassiteron. That tin was known, however, from very early
times is proved, not only by the discovery of numerous early Egyptian
and Assyrian bronze relics, but also by its being noted by Moses
among the spoils of the Midianites which were to be purified by fire;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
and by Ezekiel among the metals of which Tarshish was the merchant
of Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The allusions of Herodotus leave no room to doubt that
his information was derived indirectly from others. The Ph&#339;nicians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>long concealed the situation of the Cassiterides from all other nations;
and even Pliny treats as a fable the report of certain islands
existing in the Atlantic from whence white-lead or tin was brought.
It need not therefore surprise us to learn so little of these islands from
ancient writers, even though we adopt the opinion that they continued
for many centuries to be the chief source of one of the most
useful metals. Antimony is found in the Kurdish mountains, and
pure copper ore abounds there, as well as in those of the desert of
Mount Sinai, but no tin is known throughout any part of Assyria.
It is indeed a metal of rare occurrence, though found in apparently
inexhaustible quantities in a very few localities. The only districts,
according to Berzelius, where it is obtained in Asia, are the island of
Banca, only discovered in 1710, and the peninsula of Malacca, where
Wilkinson conceives it possible that tin may have been wrought by
the Egyptians. The mines of Malacca are very productive, and may
have been the source from whence Tyre derived "the multitude of
riches," but we have no evidence in support of such conjectures.
Cornwall still yields a larger quantity of the ore than any other
locality of the Old or New World where it has yet been discovered,
and many thousands of tons have been exported by modern traders
to India and China, and to America. Taking all these circumstances
into consideration, it seems in no degree improbable, that long before
Solomon sent to Tyre for "a worker filled with wisdom, and understanding,
and cunning, to work all works in brass," or employed the
fleets of Hiram, King of Tyre, to bring him precious metals and costly
stores for the Temple at Jerusalem, the Ph&#339;nician ships had passed
beyond the pillars of Hercules, and were familiar with the inexhaustible
stores of these remote islands of the sea which first dawn on
history as the source of this most ancient alloy. Strabo's description
of the natives of the Cassiterides is not to be greatly relied upon.
According to him they were a nomade pastoral race, of peaceful and
industrious habits; but he refers especially to their mines of tin and
lead, the produce of which they exchanged with the foreign traders,
along with furs and skins, for earthenware, salt, and copper vessels
and implements.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to conceive of such an intercourse carried on
for centuries, by nations far advanced in the arts, and familiar with
the civilisation and learning of the oldest races of Asia and Africa,
without the natives of the Cassiterides acquiring from them some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
knowledge of the fruits of ancient civilisation. From them, indeed,
it has been supposed that the British miner first learned even to
smelt the ores, though we are almost forced to the conclusion that
the working of the mines must have originated with natives or new
colonists, familiarized in some degree with the nature of the metals,
and with metallurgic arts. It seems surprising, however, that relics
formed of the most abundant native metal, tin, should not be found
in the tumuli. The facility with which it could be wrought rendered
it readily convertible into personal ornaments, equally beautiful as
those so abundant in copper and bronze. Borlase describes a patera
of tin found at Bossens, in the parish of St. Erth, Cornwall, in 1756,
rudely inscribed in mixed characters,&mdash;&lambda;IVIVS . MO&delta;ESTVS &delta;&eta;IV&lambda;I . F . &Delta;EO .
MARTI.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Along with this were two other vessels of the
same metal, an uninscribed patera, and a vase or præfericulum. In
1793 a tin cup of singular form was found, along with a circular
ornament of bronze, evidently of native British workmanship, in
searching for the ore in a stream work called Hallivich, in the
same county,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> so that we are not without some evidence that this
metal was employed at an early period in the manufacture of sacred
and domestic vessels. Probably, indeed, we should infer, from the
great rarity of such relics, that it was only so used before its native
workers had learned to mix it with copper and produce the more
useful alloy which superseded the pure metals; as bronze and copper
appear to have been at first imported, and received in exchange for
the pure tin. Barter, however, could not possibly be continued for
centuries, exchanging the ore of a metal so readily fusible as tin for
wrought materials of copper, whether pure or alloyed&mdash;a metal found
in the same locality, in a state requiring little smelting to bring it
into use-without the British miner and trader learning to turn their
own native mineral wealth to account. The facilities of a metallic
currency were also little likely to remain unappreciated by the British
trader, familiar as these already were to the seamen of the Mediterranean,
or the Ph&#339;nician colonists of Cadiz, the ancient Gadeira.
Independently of the ring-money which was probably derived from
these sources, evidence in confirmation of this idea is not wanting.
So recently as the year 1833 a bi-frontal bust of the Egyptian Isis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>was dug up in South Street, Exeter.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> According to Mr. W. T. P.
Shortt's reading of the hieroglyphics upon it, it is inscribed with the
prefix <i>Isis, Lady, Mistress of the World</i>. Beneath this has been
a cartouche, the greater portion of which is unfortunately cut away.
Mr. Shortt conceives it to have been the cartouche of Cleopatra Tryphæna,
of the race of the thirteenth Ptolemy, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 51; but as there
is only the fragment of one of the phonetics, this reading is necessarily
conjectural. In 1835 some Carthaginian medals were found
at Abbeville, in Picardie; and at Noyelles sur Mer, another figure of
Isis was discovered in bronze, along with a statuette of the Hawk-headed
deity, or elder Horus.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Egyptian relics of the era of the later
Ptolemies are not unknown as accompaniments of Roman sepulchral
deposits, both in Britain and on the Continent; but they must be
assumed to belong to an older era when found along with Greek and
Carthaginian coins.</p>

<p>But more conclusive evidence exists in proof of early intercourse
with the Mediterranean, if not, indeed, of the opinion advocated by a
zealous local antiquary, that Exeter had been the seat of a Ph&#339;nician
colony many centuries prior to the arrival of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It was long
maintained by the great majority of English numismatists, that the
Britons had no native coinage prior to the Roman invasion and the
mintage of Cunobeline,&mdash;the work, as is presumed, of a Roman artist.
The evidence against the existence of an early native coinage was, at
best, purely negative, and is now giving way before the investigations
of our ablest numismatists. The coins peculiar to the Channel Islands
are generally acknowledged to be of an earlier character, and it is
maintained not only that a native mintage existed prior to the Roman
invasion, but that the convex and concave form, which characterizes the
earliest British types, affords evidence that they were formed in imitation
of Greek coins.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The Rev. Beale Post has most ingeniously traced
the Gaulish coinage to its primitive Greek type. The conclusions he

335 the Gauls adopted as their model the gold coinage struck by
Philip II. of Macedon, and from that early Greek type, with its reverse
of Diana driving her biga, we may trace the original of all the
singular and rude representations of the horse on the primitive Gaulish
and British native coinage, which have been supposed to involve so
many mythological fancies. There is something greatly more characteristic
of the imperfect ideas of a native currency likely to be
formed by a primitive and partially civilized people, in this arbitrary
imitation of a foreign type, than in any abstruse embodiment of the
national creed. No precise date has yet been attempted to be assigned
for the first native British coinage, but the numerous examples
of Gaulish types discovered in Britain leave no room to doubt that
the native Britons were familiar with such a circulating medium long
prior to the Roman invasion. Nor is this the most primitive form of
native currency. Several hoards have been discovered at different times
in Scotland, of small gold pellets, marked with a cross or star in relief,
and which, there can be little doubt, is the earliest Scottish minted
money.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Examples of this primitive coinage are more particularly
described in a subsequent chapter, among the contents of the later
tumuli.</p>

<p>But entirely apart either from this or the coinage derived from the
Gauls, very remarkable discoveries of ancient foreign coins, such as
those referred to above, suffice to suggest the probability that the
primitive Briton had other sources from whence to acquire a knowledge
of the convenience and fashion of a coined circulating medium.
In the same locality where the bust of the Egyptian Isis was dug up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
at Exeter, numerous Greek coins have been found of late years, chiefly
belonging to the autonomous Greek colonial cities in Syria and Asia
Minor. Many have been discovered pertaining to Alexandria in
Egypt, including coins of the Ptolemies of a very early date, frequently
met with at great depths, and apparently in older strata than
that of the Anglo-Roman period.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In making a large drain in the
Fore Street of Exeter, in 1810, at a depth of twenty feet below the
present pavement, an immense quantity of ancient money was found,
including many early coins of the autonomous Greek cities, and
along with them two British coins, one bearing the wheel and the
other the horse.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Coins of Agrigentum, in Sicily, of Hiero I. of Syracuse,
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 460; of Ptolemy I. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 323, and many others described and
engraved in Mr. Shortt's interesting works, have been found at various
times in Exeter and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But though these singularly interesting tokens of intercourse with
the Ph&#339;nician and Greek maritime colonies long prior to the era of the
Roman occupation of Britain abound, as might be anticipated, only in
the localities where mineral wealth tempted the sojourn of the ancient
trader, yet some few remarkable traces of the same communication
with the elder empires of the world have been found within our more
northern limits. Occasionally Greek coins have been discovered in
Scotland; as, for example, a gold didrachm of Philip of Macedon,
three Greek silver coins, including one of his son, and a brass of the
Brutii in Magna Græcia, found on the estate of Cairnbulg, Aberdeenshire,
in 1824; and a very fine gold coin of Alexander the Great, at
Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> In the year 1845 a still more remarkable
hoard was discovered on the farm of Braco, in the parish of Shotts,
Lanarkshire, only a very small portion of which was rescued from
the usual fate of such recovered treasures. I have examined a few of
these, in the hands of John Henderson, Esq., Queen's Remembrancer
for Scotland. They include of Greek coins: one of Athens, obverse
Archaic head of Pallas; reverse: <i>&#913; &#920;</i>, owl in deep indented square,
an olive branch behind. One of Phocis, obverse: laureated head of
Apollo; reverse: full-faced head of bull. One of B&#339;otia, obverse:
B&#339;otian shield; reverse: vase. Also one Parthian coin. (Eckhel,
vol. i. p. 254. Arsaces <span class="smcap">XV.</span>) A correspondent from whom I first received
information of this important discovery, saw several more of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>the Athenian type; some with the Greek scarabæus or tortoise, and
others, which from the description appear to have been Parthian coins.
But on inquiry being made after them, nearly the whole disappeared,
and it is to be feared were immediately consigned to the melting pot.
This remarkable hoard, unequalled in historic value, as far as I know,
by any discovery of coins yet made in Scotland, may perchance after
all have only been the treasure of some Roman auxiliary, as Braco is
on the line of the iter which came from the south, towards the station
of Castlecarry, on the wall of Antoninus Pius. Only the year after,
a most valuable hoard of undoubted Roman treasure was found on the
same farm. According to the account of their discoverer&mdash;a farm
servant&mdash;"nearly a barrowful" were recovered, but they were squandered
and lost before information of the discovery could reach those
who were competent to appreciate their value as anything but old
metal. An intelligent correspondent, to whom I am indebted for some
particulars of this last discovery at Braco, succeeded in securing a few
of the coins, comprehending Vespasian, Titus, both the Antonines,
Lucius Verus, both the Faustinas, Trajan, Hadrian, and Commodus.
These, however, lay entirely apart from the former hoard, and apparently
much nearer the surface, so that we need not necessarily assume
the deposition of the former coins, belonging to a period so long prior
to the era of Roman invasion, as depending on the Roman iter, which
like more recent thoroughfares, may have followed in the line of older
pathways through the Caledonian forests.</p>

<p>Along with these examples, suggestive of direct or indirect intercourse
between the early Britons and Greek or Ph&#339;nician traders,
should also perhaps be mentioned two Greek altars in the British
Museum, found at Corbridge in Northumberland; the one dedicated
to the Syrian Astarte, thus&mdash;&#913;&#931;&#932;&#913;&#929;&#932;&#919;&#931;, &#914;&#937;&#924;&#927;&#925; &#924;'&#917;&#931;&#927;&#929;&#913;&#931; &#928;&#927;&#933;&#923;&#935;&#917;&#929;
&#924;'&#913;&#925;&#917;&#920;&#919;&#922;&#917;&#925;. On its sides are sculptured the most common
sacrificial vessels, the præfericulum and patera, and the top is crowned
with the usual thuribulum of the Roman altar. The other, which
was discovered in the churchyard of Corbridge, is dedicated to the
Tyrian Hercules. It bears on the one side a bull's head, with the
secespita beside it, and on the other a laurel crown. In front is the
inscription,&mdash;&#919;&#929;&#913;&#922;&#923;&#917;&#921; &#932;&#933;&#929;&#921;&#937; &#916;&#921;&#927;&#916;&#937;&#929;&#913; &#913;&#929;&#935;&#921;&#917;&#929;&#917;, &#913;.</p>

<p>The curious reader will find by reference to the Archæologia,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>the learned reconcile with previous theories the discovery in this
northern region of altars thus dedicated to Ph&#339;nician deities, to whom
according to Josephus, Hiram king of Tyre, the contemporary of
Solomon, erected separate temples. Camden records, on the authority
of Solinus, called Polyhistor, that a votive altar was erected in
North Britain, in honour of Ulysses, and inscribed in Greek characters.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
Whatever credit be attached to this, we have no reason to
doubt that Greek voyagers traded to the British Isles long before the
Roman war galleys touched its shores; though the site of the former
altars, near the Roman wall, and their correspondence in form and
decorations to the Roman altars so frequently found in Britain, seem
to justify the conclusion that they are the work of Greek auxiliaries
of the Anglo-Roman era, and indicate a late rather than an early
date within that period.</p>

<p>The interest which attaches to the determination of the extent and
probable date of the first intercourse of the Britons with traders from
the far east, has led to the anticipation of some points not strictly
belonging to the present section of our inquiry. This question of the
existence of a native coinage, or of the substitution of a foreign metallic
currency for the rude process of barter, at a period prior to the introduction
of Roman customs by the legionaries of the first and second
centuries, well merits the careful study it is now receiving, since no
other evidence could furnish equally satisfactory proof of early progress
in social civilisation. It cannot admit of doubt, however, that long
before even the Greek or Ph&#339;nician trader had taught the Cornish
miner this ingenious substitute for a direct exchange of commodities,
he had learned to fuse and work the rich veins of ore with which his
native soil abounded, and to fashion them into a variety of personal
ornaments as well as of weapons and implements. The Ph&#339;nician
sought his tin in order to mix it with the copper which he already
possessed, and thereby to produce bronze weapons combining the
ductility of copper with that indispensable hardness which could
alone fit them to supersede the older implements of stone. How
early this interchange first took place, it appears now altogether vain
to inquire. The evidence already adduced, however, is at least suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>cient
to justify us in assigning to it a very remote period, while the
more abundant and far more useful metal, iron, was little known even
to the oldest nations along the Mediterranean coasts. Worsaae remarks,
"There are geological reasons for believing that the Bronze
Period must have prevailed in Denmark five or six hundred years
before the birth of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Denmark, however, had all its metal to
import, while the earliest historic allusion to England represents her
exporting her abundant metallic ores, and bartering them with the
southern merchant for the productions of his superior skill. The metallic
riches of England have not escaped the attention of the intelligent
Danish archæologist:&mdash;"It is highly probable," he remarks,
"that the ancient bronze, formed of copper and tin, was diffused from
one spot over the whole of Europe; which spot may be supposed to
be England, because, not to mention the quantity of copper which
that country produces, its rich tin mines have been known from the
earliest historic periods to the nations of the south, while in the other
parts of Europe there occur only very few and doubtful remains of far
less important tin mines which we are justified in believing to have
been worked at that time."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>When we consider that copper is not only found in a state requiring
little smelting to render it fit for manufacture, but that it is even discovered
at times so pure that we may conceive of its occasional substitution
for stone implements, before the art of smelting had become
known, we can feel no hesitation in assuming, <i>a priori</i>, that it was
the precursor of iron as a material for the construction of weapons and
tools. Iron, on the contrary, bears, in its natural state, little resemblance
to a metal, and is smelted by so difficult and tedious a process
that, even after its superiority had become known, the older metal
would probably be preferred by the natives of a thinly peopled
country, where the benefits of mutual cooperation and the division of
labour still remained among the unsolved problems of their political
economy. The tools and weapons of the ancient Mexicans we know
were of copper, and we are not without evidence that even the Egyptians
were far advanced in their early developed civilisation before
iron had superseded the older copper tools. The architectural monuments
of Mexico and Yucatan show how much might be accomplished
with such imperfect implements. Both in the magnificent work of
the French savans, and in the more accurate delineations of M. Rosellini,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>various Egyptian paintings are shewn, in which the implements
of the sculptors are evidently of bronze or copper, and workmen are
seen cutting blocks of granite and hewing out colossal statues with
yellow tools. Numerous bronze weapons, implements, and personal
ornaments found in the catacombs, attest the use of this metal by the
Egyptians at a comparatively late period. Implements of copper are
also among the relics found in some of the ancient and long abandoned
mines discovered in Asia. The celebrated tables in the copper
mines of Wady Maghara, near Sinai, record the conquest of that part
of Asia by Suphis, the builder of the great pyramid, and prove that
these mines had been wrought prior to the early date of his reign.
Dr. Layard also refers to copper mines still existing in the mountains
within the confines of Assyria, worked at a very remote period, probably
by the Assyrians, and used not only to supply the material for
ornaments, but also for weapons and tools.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> But there is not wanting
abundant direct evidence to prove that Asia had her Bronze Period
as well as Europe and Africa. Dr. Prichard remarks, "Silver and
golden ornaments of rude workmanship, though in abundant quantity,
are found in the Siberian tombs. The art of fabricating ornaments
of the precious metals seems to have preceded by many ages the use
of iron in the northern regions of Asia."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> A very interesting account
is given in the Archæologia of a tumulus opened in the neighbourhood
of Asterabad, on the south-eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, in 1841.
It contained several vessels and two small trumpets, all of pure gold;
spears, pikes, forks, and other weapons, including a well-shaped hammer
and hatchet of copper, but no traces of iron.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The descriptions of
Homer point out the era of the Iliad and the Odyssey as a bronze period;
and Hesiod, as well as later writers, intimate clearly the use of bronze
by the Greeks before they had learned to smelt or work the iron ore.
The golden age of Saturn, and the succeeding silver, brazen, and iron
ages, by which the Greek Sagas figure the gradual decline of mankind
from a state of primeval purity and happiness, are not to be regarded
as mere poetical images. "In the brazen age," says Schlegel,
in his Philosophy of History, "crime and disorder reached their
height; violence was the characteristic of the rude and gigantic
Titans. Their arms were of copper, and their implements and utensils
of brass or bronze. Even in their edifices copper was employed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>for as the Greek poet says, 'black iron was not then known;' a circumstance
which must be considered as strictly historical, and as
characteristic of the primitive nations."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>We have seen, in so far as the imperfect data already referred to
afford trustworthy indications of the physical characteristics of the
primitive colonists of Britain, that the race of the later era differed
greatly from their elder and probably aboriginal precursors of the
primeval period. We must depend not only on the united observations
of British archæologists for adding to these ethnological data,
but also on Continental research for supplying the necessary elements
of comparison by which we may hope to trace out the origin of the
Brachy-kephalic race of Scotland, to whom it seems probable that the
introduction of the primitive metallurgic arts must be ascribed; while
it may be that we shall yet be able clearly to associate the full development
of these, prior to the working of iron, with the intrusion of
the Celtæ upon the elder Allophylian British races.</p>

<p>Whencesoever the first knowledge of the metallurgic arts was derived,
it introduced into the British Isles the elements of a change
scarcely less momentous than those which later ages trace to letters,
the magnet, the printing-press, or these latest applications of the
metals&mdash;the railway and the electric telegraph. The native Briton
was no longer confined to his little clearing on the coast, nor compelled
with ingenious toil to fashion the shapeless flint and stone into
the weapons and implements that supplied his simple wants. The
forests rang with the axe and the wedge; the low grounds were gradually
cleared of their primeval forests; and the fruits of patient industry
were substituted, in part at least, for the spoils of the chase.
Still the change was wrought, as might be anticipated, only by very
slow degrees. The weapons and implements would in many localities
long precede the knowledge of the arts by which they were formed.
The old generation would die out, and be buried with the stone war-hatchet
and spear, while the younger race were learning to despise
such imperfect arms. Necessity also, arising from their costliness and
scarcity, would long confine the majority to the primitive and inefficient
tools and weapons of their fathers. Even after the flint lance
had been entirely superseded by the bronze sword and spear, the
missile weapons would still be made of the old material, and the large
stone hammer would be retained in use as too bulky an object to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
constructed of the more costly metal. It is probable, indeed, that stone
implements were never entirely abandoned throughout the whole
Bronze Period. No large bronze hammers have ever been found in
Britain, while those of stone frequently occur along with metallic
remains; and the larger hammers and axes, chiefly of granite, are
among the most abundant of Scottish primitive relics. So recently
as the month of October 1849, an ancient working of great extent
was broken into at the Llandudno Copper Mines, at Ormes Head, in
North Wales. In this were found a great number of stone hammers
or mauls of various sizes, weighing from two to forty pounds,
supposed to have been used in crushing the ore or detaching it
from the rock. There also lay beside them a number of bones, and
the portion of a bronze tool; affording altogether one of the most interesting
discoveries yet made illustrative of the arts of the British
Bronze Period.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Traces of ancient mining operations have also been
found in Scotland. Pennant describes trenches in the Island of Jura
by which the veins both of lead and copper have been wrought in
very early times, and by instruments unknown to the modern miner.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Abundant evidence is found in accordance with these indications,
proving the existence of a long transition-period, during which metallic
tools and arms were only very partially introduced, and were manifestly
esteemed as rare and precious possessions. To this transition-period
we should probably assign the formation of the smaller and most
carefully wrought varieties of the stone hammer, with which we may
presume the ingenious worker in the newly mastered metals to have
wrought, and fashioned into shape, many of the rude but massive gold
ornaments found in the tumuli. From the number of these relics of
the precious metals which have been discovered, we are irresistibly led
to the conclusion that gold must have been much more abundant at
that remote era than it has been within the period of authentic history.
Nor is it difficult to account for such a state of things. Though
usually found in very small quantities, gold is well known as one of
the most widely diffused of all the metals; and the clay slate which
frequently forms the depository of gold, silver, and copper, exists in
great abundance throughout the Highlands. In the Leadhills of
Scotland considerable quantities of gold have been procured at no
very distant period, while numerous allusions suffice to shew its greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>abundance in former times.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> In the twelfth century the Abbey of
Dunfermline received a grant from David I. of the tithe of all the gold
produced by the surrounding districts of Fife and Forthrev;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and
even in the sixteenth century the Laird of Merchiston is said to have
wrought gold in the Pentland Hills.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> In the remoter era, however, to
which we now refer, when the rude Caledonian was learning, for the
first time, to fashion his weapons and tools of bronze, and to substitute
the golden torc and armilla for the necklace of perforated
shells or stone and amber beads, we are justified in assuming from
analogy that in many of the channels of the Scottish mountain
streams,&mdash;amid the strata of which the ore has been found,&mdash;not only
the gold dust, but pure masses of native gold would be occasionally
discovered, and wrought with no better tools than the stone hammer
and anvil into the personal ornaments of distinguished leaders or
priests. Strabo, in referring to the great mineral wealth of Spain,
which made it to the ancients what America became to the Spaniards
long after their native mineral treasures were exhausted, remarks,&mdash;"In
no country are gold, silver, copper, and iron, so abundant or of
such fine quality; even the rivers and mountain streams bring down
gold in their beds, which is found in their sands." Yet such a description
is now as little applicable to Spain as to Scotland. But more
recent and conclusive evidence exists. Much sensation was excited
in 1795 by the discovery of gold dust in the bed of the brook Ballinasloge,
a feeder of the Avonmore river, about seven miles west from
Arklow, county Wicklow. The stream is formed there at the junc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>tion
of three ravines; and in this spot John Lloyd, Esq., F.R.S., a
correspondent of Sir Joseph Banks,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> describes upwards of three hundred
women, besides men and children, all engaged at one time in
searching for the precious metal:&mdash;a scene not difficult to parallel in
our own day. The searchers, however, were abundantly rewarded for
their labour. The gold was found in masses varying from a few grains
to five ounces in weight, and one piece, weighing twenty-two ounces,
was reserved as a present to His Majesty. A later correspondent,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> in
a communication to the Royal Society, calculates that 800 ounces of
gold were collected in the short space of six weeks, at the end of
which time the gatherers were dispersed by a body of militia, and the
gold area held for behoof of Government. "The gold," says Mr.
Mills, "is of a bright yellow colour, perfectly malleable; the specific
gravity of an apparently clean piece 19,000. A specimen, assayed
here in the moist way, produced from 24 grains 22-58/101 grains of pure
gold, and 1-45/101 of silver. Some of the gold is intimately blended with,
and adherent to quartz; some, it is said, was found united to the fine
grained iron-stone, but the major part was entirely free from the
matrix; every piece more or less rounded on the edges, of various
weights, forms, and sizes."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Specimens were afterwards assayed by the
Royal Mint Master at the Tower of London. One piece contained,
in 24 carats, 21-6/8 of fine gold, 1&#x215E; of fine silver, and &#x215D; of alloy, which
seemed to be copper tinged with a little iron.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Such an example may be reasonably received as supplying one satisfactory
clue to the sources of the gold which we find to have been so
abundant in early times; though we shall still, perhaps, consistently
account for the introduction of some portion of it indirectly by foreign
barter, and chiefly in the shape of the ring-money hereafter referred
to. But when the fact is borne in remembrance that articles of silver
are rarely, if ever, found in connexion with relics of the Bronze Period,
it must be acknowledged as most consistent with the geological and
mineralogical characteristics of auriferous and argentiferous deposits to
look to native sources for the supply of gold. While silver is found
only in large quantities by mining, gold has invariably been discovered
in largest quantities in the superficial detritus, and accumulated in
circumscribed areas. Whenever, therefore, we are enabled to trace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>the supply of gold to a foreign, as, for example, to a Ph&#339;nician source,
we can hardly fail to find accompanying relics of silver; and accordingly,
in the succeeding, or Iron Period, the gold becomes of rare occurrence,
and the silver abundant. One other argument should not be
altogether overlooked. The great purity of very many of the gold
ornaments found in the tumuli is such as may perhaps add to the probability
of its native origin. This well-known fact has frequently
supplied an additional inducement to transfer to the crucible many of
the rarest and most valuable relics of this period. Others found alloyed
with silver are in no fixed or uniform proportions, but rather in
accordance with the accidental mixtures likely to occur in the operations
of the primitive miner and metallurgist. But this, though
diminishing their bullion value, has not sufficed to save such national
heirlooms from destruction. After reposing in the safe muniment
chambers of their original owners, with but a foot of earth above
them, while ancient races have become extinct and new colonists
have risen to mighty nations above their forgotten graves, these treasures
have only been restored to light to be immediately destroyed.
The barbarity of such proceedings has hardly yet been fully exposed.
It is the destruction of national records in the meanest spirit of cupidity,
which no wealth could restore, and for which not even the poor
excuse can be found that satisfied the fanatic Caliph Omar when he
converted the treasures of the Alexandrian Library into fuel for the
city baths.</p>

<p>Remote as is the period when the novel arts of the metallurgist
broke in upon the simple and unsophisticated habits of the British
aborigines, some traces of the memory of this mighty change still
linger amid the popular traditions of England. The use which Sir
Walter Scott has made of the Berkshire legend of Wayland Smith has
sufficed to confer a fictitious interest on, perhaps without exception,
the most remarkable of all the mythic traditions common to the nations
of northern Europe, and which may be unhesitatingly received as
the traditionary memorial of the advent of the Bronze Period among
the Teutonic races. True, indeed, in the only definite form in which
it is now recoverable from the early and medieval literature of Europe,
it is associated with the later age of iron rather than with that of
bronze; but little importance can be attached to this. The legend
is manifestly of an older date even than the Edda, that venerable collection
of the sacred writings of the north. We see in it the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>hero-worship
of the fierce Norsemen deifying their Scandinavian Vulcan,
and assigning to him a superhuman origin as an evidence of their
estimate of the divine gift he is supposed to have bestowed. But the
mythic legend finds its prototype in the Greek Dædalus, if not in the
Mosaic Tubal-Cain. It is incorporated into nearly all the older European
tongues with singular uniformity of idea. In the Icelandic the
name of the renowned northern metallurgist is Vælund and Vaulundr;
in old high German, Wiolant, Wielant; in Anglo-Saxon, W&ecirc;land; in old
English, Weland and Velond; and in the modern popular dialect,
Wayland. In the Latin of the middle ages it becomes Guielandus;
and in old French, Galans and Galant. It is probable that Spain,
Italy, and the East above all, had analogous traditions, some of which
at least may yet be recovered.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> According to a singular, and seemingly
arbitrary caprice of the medieval Germanic traditions, the forge
of Weland is supposed to be erected in the Caucasus; and Michel
remarks, as a proof that there has been a common origin of these
legends of the east and west relating to skilful workers in iron, that
some of the traditions still preserved on the banks of the Euphrates
present the same traits recorded by the poets of the middle ages on
the banks of the Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> But Humboldt has justly remarked that
"the characteristic features of nations, like the internal construction
of plants spread over the surface of the globe, were the impressions
of a primitive type." The Aztecks,&mdash;to whom we have already referred
as a remarkable example of considerable civilisation, and the extensive
practice of many useful and ornamental arts, among a people destitute
of iron and very partially furnished with metals,&mdash;had their
mythic metallurgist as well as the older races of Europe and Asia.
Quetzalcoath, whose reign was the golden age of the people of Anahuac,
was the Weland of the Aztecks, worshipped among them with
strange and bloody rites. Their traditions told that he had dwelt
among them twenty years, and had taught them to cast metals, ordered
fasts, and regulated the intercalations of the Tolteck year.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Prominent as the place is which the mythic legend of the smith-god
occupied in the popular creed of the middle ages throughout the
greater part of Europe, the tradition of a gifted worker in metals is
doubtless of eastern origin, and far more fitly impersonates and deifies
the restoration of the metallurgic arts in the primitive Bronze Period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>than the mere transition from bronze to iron, important as the latter
change undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>The remarkable analogy of the mythic legends of the North with
the ancient Greek fable of Dædalus, has not escaped the notice of
modern critics, and MM. Depping and Michel remark:&mdash;"We do not
hesitate to believe that it is the history of this Greek artist, altered
and disfigured, adapted to the manners and creeds of the people of
the north of Europe, which has given rise to the romance of Weland."
The resemblance, however, is scarcely less manifest, in many respects,
to the lame smith-god &#7977;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;, or Vulcan; and the widely-diffused
mythic fable is far too complete and unique to have been transferred
directly from the Greek to the Teutonic mythology, where scarce
another trace of similar correspondence is discernible. Jupiter, Mars,
Hercules, Venus, Orpheus, all find their counterparts indeed, but with
scarce a shadow of resemblance to Greek prototypes, in the wild Scandinavian
and old German pantheon, which may reasonably excite our
wonder, if we assume a Greek origin for the <i>V&#339;lundar Quida</i> contained
in the Edda. In the simplest form in which it is still recoverable,
it is obviously overlaid with spurious additions of a later
age; and when it gets into the monkish chronicles and romances of
chivalry compiled in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the wild
faith of the Norsemen is outdone by the wilder fictions of the
Trouveres, and nearly all the symbolic spirit of the original disappears.
Some of these even assign precise periods as the era of the
northern smith. Several of the French romances mention Galand as
the maker of Charlemagne's famous sword Durendal, while others describe
armour forged by him and weapons inscribed with his name.
But the most curious notice of this kind occurs in an English manuscript
written about the time of Edward I. It contains a description
of the sword of Gauvain, one of the most celebrated knights of
Arthur's "Round Table," made by Galant, and having the following
lines inscribed in <i>canello gladii</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jeo su forth trenchant e dure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Galaan me fyth par mult grant cure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catorse anz [out] Jhesu Cristh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quant Galaan me trempa e fyth;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, "I am very sharp and hard; Galaan made me with very great
care; fourteen years old was Jesus Christ when Galaan tempered
and made me." Other romances furnish with swords of Galant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
workmanship both Julius Cæsar and Alexander the Great, and by
inheritance from the latter, Ptolemy, Judas Maccabæus, and the
Emperor Vespasian.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Such spurious inventions, however, lack all
the value of the original symbolic legend. We read indeed in the
romance of Fierabras d'Mixandre, of three famous swords made by
Galans and his two brothers; of one of which it is related,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"C&eacute;sars li emper&egrave;res l'ot maint jor en demagne,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>If this idea stood alone, or was conceived in the simple spirit of the
Scandinavian V&#339;lund-Chaunt, we might imagine it to be designed as
a symbolic myth representing the advent of the Iron Period and its
irresistible progress over the north; but the general spirit of the romance
is characterized by the usual extravagance of medieval poetry.</p>

<p>The Greeks assigned to the history of Dædalus a very high antiquity,
carrying him back to somewhere about the thirteenth century
before the Christian era; but it may admit of doubt if Greece had
then passed her own primitive stage. Among the relics of the
European Stone Period preserved in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries are some small flint-flakes and arrow-heads, gathered on
the elevated mound of the tomb of the Plateans at Marathon, which
it will not greatly outrage the ideas of the critical historian to assume
as weapons used by the Greek patriots in repelling the Persian
invader. At first the word Dædalus was, among the Greeks, like
that of Weland among the Scandinavians, a generic name. &#916;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#969;
signified to work artistically, as <i>Voelundr</i> signified a smith in Islandic;
and Dædalus was, like Weland, pre-eminently the artist and the workman.
The word became a proper name only because of their attributing
to this mythological being all the perfections of the art. For
this reason also, it appears equally erroneous to regard the Islandic
word voelund, a smith, as derived from Weland: it is the contrary that
should be assumed. The word <i>voelund</i> existed before the history of the
famous smith Weland had been invented, just as the word &#948;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#969;
existed before the personification Dædalus had been adopted into
the mythology of the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> This is no new idea. It was obvi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>ously
from a recognition of it that King Alfred, when translating the
<i>De Consolatione Philosophiæ</i> of Boethius into Anglo-Saxon, used the
name of the northern Weland as synonymous with <i>Fabricius</i>. Mr.
Singer has employed the Greek fable of Dædalus to restore the connexion
of the arts of the north with the elder civilisation of Europe,
and Dr. Sickler has applied the same classic legend with great ingenuity
in his argument of the Ph&#339;nician origin of the Greek metallurgic
arts.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Whencesoever that knowledge may have been immediately
derived, we shall adopt the most consistent idea if we turn
back to the Eastern cradle-land both of the Hellenic and Scandinavian
races, and assume a common origin for the mythic fable which
records with corresponding symbolic legends the restoration of the art
of Tubal-Cain to the postdiluvian race.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable and interesting fact, that while modern learning
and research have brought to light the most ancient literate forms of
this northern myth, in the Edda and the Niebelungen Lied, it is in
England only that it has survived to our own day as a living popular
tradition; and it is due to the somewhat grotesque travesty of
its rude Berkshire version inwrought into the tragic tale of Kenilworth,
that it has been restored to the favour of modern Europe.
Among the old Scandinavian nations, and in Iceland, where the language
of their runic literature is still a living tongue, as well as in
France, and throughout the whole Germanic races of the Continent,
all memory of the restoration of this divine gift of the metals has utterly
passed away. In England only&mdash;towards which we see the galleys
of the elder inheritors of civilisation winging their way in quest of its
metallic treasures with the first glimpse we catch of it as it emerges
out of the night of time&mdash;the mythic legend has retained vitality till
now. How the story of our northern Dædalus came to be associated
with the monolithic group at the foot of White-Horse Hill, in the vale
of Berkshire, it is now equally vain and useless to inquire. There, according
to rustic folk-lore, dwelt the invisible smith. No one ever saw
him; but he who had the courage to avail himself of his skill had only to
deposit a piece of money on one of the stones, and leave his horse beside
it. On his return the horse was found to be shod, and the money
gone. Such was the last shadowy tradition of the venerable myth. On
one of the rarer coins of Cunobeline an armourer or coiner is represented.
Some numismatists have supposed it to be Vulcan forging a helmet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>May it not more probably be assumed as the northern Weland, whose
metallurgic skill was so widely celebrated among the Teutonic nations?
Before the great Alfred had won his way to the English
throne the symbolic impersonation had assumed a perfect individuality;
and in the translation of the <i>De Consolatione Philosophiæ</i> into
Anglo-Saxon, he thus paraphrases the passage,&mdash;Ubi nunc fidelis
ossa Fabricii manent? Quid Brutus, aut rigidus Cato?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where are now the bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wise Weland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goldsmith<br /></span>

<span class="i0"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>If little importance be due to the association of Weland's name with
the working in iron, not very much more is to be ascribed to the no
less frequent depiction of him as a cunning jeweller and goldsmith.
Nevertheless, the circumstance is worthy of notice in passing, since it
is not impossible that the working in gold may have preceded even
the age of bronze, and in reality have belonged, as already hinted, to
the Stone Period. If metal could be found capable of being wrought
and fashioned without smelting or moulding, its use was perfectly
compatible with the simple arts of the Stone Period. Of such use
masses of native gold, such as have been often found both in the Old
and the New World, are peculiarly susceptible; and some of the examples
of Scottish gold personal ornaments fully correspond with the
probable results of such an anticipatory use of the metals. One very
remarkable example, more particularly referred to hereafter, occurs in
a pair of armillæ of pure gold, found in an urn of the rudest and most
artless construction in a cist in Banffshire. They are merely hammered
into rounded bars and then bent to fit the arm, and they retain the
rough marks of the tool, which it is more easy to imagine one of stone
than any more delicate or artificial implement. It is not impossible
that it may be owing to some faint traditional remembrance of this
primitive origin of the working of metals, that the oldest notices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Weland represent him chiefly as the cunning goldsmith, as in the
fifth stanza of the V&#339;lundar Quida of the Edda:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"V&#339;lund alone remained in Ulfdale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wrought red gold, with jewells rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Securing on a withy rings many."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So it is in all the earliest existing forms of this ancient myth, the
working in iron is only superadded to the skill of the famous goldsmith.</p>

<p>No Celtic legend preserves an equally distinct memorial of the
introduction of the metallurgic arts among the ancient colonists of the
British Isles. Nevertheless the Scottish Highlanders have their native
&#7977;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; also, personified, like the Teutonic Weland, in many
romantic legends. The fame of Luno, the son of Leven, who made
the swords of Fingal and his heroes, is preserved in old traditional
poems, which figure him as a wild savage clad in a mantle of black
hide, and with an apron of similar materials. The additional features
of the picture furnish no inapt personification of the classic Vulcan.
He is described as lame; going on one leg, with a staff in his hand,
yet remarkable for his swiftness.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Dr. Macculloch, in demonstrating
the affinity between the Celtic and Teutonic superstitions and the
Oriental and classic mythology, remarks,&mdash;"Fingal is not an absolute
original himself. His sword is the sword of sharpness of the
Edda, made by Velent or Weyland, the hyperborean Vulcan. It is
the wonderful sword Skoffnung, and also Balmung, and it is the
Mimmung in Ettin Langshanks. It is equally Tyrsing, the fairy
blade of Suafurlami; and it is also the sword which Jack begged of
the giant. It is the sword Durandal, with which Orlando cuts rocks
in two; and it is Escalibor, the sword of Arthur."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Thus common as
the metal from which it is forged is some form or other of the mythic
legend which commemorates the restoration of old Tubal-Cain's
weapon of war. Still the venerable Teutonic myth does not appear
to have been preserved by the Scottish medieval chroniclers or romancers,
unless in some extremely modified form, or it could hardly
have escaped the notice of Dunbar, in his satire of "The Fenyeit
Freir of Tungland." The incident which gave rise to this whimsical
effusion of our great Scottish poet against the Italian charlatan occurred
in 1507, (a year famous for the introduction of the printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>press
into Scotland,) and is thus described by Bishop Lesley.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Referring
to an embassy sent to France in that year, he remarks,&mdash;"This
tyme thair wes ane Italiane with the king, quha wes maid Abbott of
Tungland, and wes of curious ingyne. He causet the king believe
that he, be multiplyinge and utheris his inventions, wold make fine
golde of uther mettall, quhilk science he callit the quintassence;
quhairupon the king maid greit cost, bot all in vaine. This Abbott
tuik in hand to flie with wingis, and to be in Fraunce befoir the saidis
ambassadouris; and to that effect he causet mak ane pair of wingis of
fedderis, quhilkis beand fessinit apoun him, he flew of the Castell wall
of Striveling, bot shortlie he fell to the ground and brak his thee bane.
Bot the wyt thairof he ascryvit to that thair was sum hen fedderis in
the wingis, quhilk yarnit and covet the mydding and not the skyis."
The Scottish historian compares him to "ane king of Yngland callit
Bladud." The poet's similes are still more pertinent; though since
we learn from the Scottish Treasurers' Accounts, that the Abbot of
Tungland was paid, in 1513, "to pass to the myne of Crawfurd-moor,"
which the king was then working for gold: and from the satire,
that he sometimes practised the Blacksmith's craft: Dunbar could
scarcely have avoided the addition of the Weland legend to his other
similes, had it been known to him, since the points of resemblance
are such, that, with less historic evidence for the truth of the Abbot's
history, we might assume it as the rude Scottish version of the V&#339;lundar
Quida:&mdash;</p>

wild beasts and game of all kinds in the
Caledonian forests is frequently alluded to.
Boece describes "gret plente of haris,
hartis, hindis, dayis, rais, wolffis, wild hors,
and toddis." (Bellenden's Boece. Cosmographe,
chap. xi.) The following curious
enumeration in Gordon's History of the
House of Sutherland, (fol. p. 3,) written
about 1630, furnishes a tolerably extensive
list of wild natives of Sutherland even in
the seventeenth century:&mdash;"All these forrests
and schases are verie profitable for
feiding of bestiall, and delectable for hunting.
They are full of reid deir and roes,
woulffs, foxes, wyld catts, brocks, skuyrrells,
whittrets, weasels, otters, martrixes,
hares, and fumarts. In these forrests, and
in all this province, ther is great store of
partriges, pluivers, capercalegs, blackwaks,
murefowls, heth-hens, swanes, bewters,
turtledoves, herons, dowes, steares or stirlings,
lair-igigh or knag, (which is a foull
lyk vnto a paroket or parret, which maks
place for her nest with her beck in the oak
trie,) duke, draig, widgeon, teale, wildgouse,
ringouse, routs, whaips, shot-whaips, woodcok,
larkes, sparrowes, snyps, blakburds or
osills, meweis, thrushes, and all other kinds
of wildfowle and birds, which ar to be had
in any pairt of this kingdome. Ther is not
one strype in all these forrests that wants
trouts and other sorts of fishes.... Ther
is vpon these rivers, and vpon all the cost
of Southerland, a great quantitie of pealoks,
sealghes or sealls, and sometymes whaills
of great bignes, with all sorts of shell fish,
and dyvers kynds of sea-foull." When we
remember that this ample inventory is of a
late date, and lacks not only the Caledonian
bull, the elk, and "the wild-bore, killed by
Gordoun, who for his valour and great manhood
was verie intire with King Malcolme-Kean-Moir,"
but also, in all probability,
many more of the older prizes of the chase,
we can readily perceive the abundant stores
that lay within reach of the thinly-peopled
districts of the primitive era. One of the
most interesting of the extinct animals of
Scotland, on many accounts, is the beaver,
(<i>Castor Europæus</i>,) already referred to
among the mammals of the primeval transition.
Its remains have been discovered
under circumstances indicative of equal antiquity
with the extinct mammoth, (Owen,
p. 191.) But their most frequent situation
is at the bottom of the peat-bog; as in the
Newbury peat-valley, where they were found
twenty feet below the present surface, associated
with the remains of the wild-boar,
roebuck, goat, deer, and wolf. Fine specimens
of a skull, under-jaw, and haunch
bone, found in Perthshire, and now in the
Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, have
been made the subject of a valuable memoir
by Dr. P. Neill, a Fellow of the Society, in the
Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, (vol. i. p.
183, and Wern. Mem. vol. iii. p. 207.) Dr.
Neill, Professor Fleming, and subsequent
writers, including Professor Owen, in referring
to the historical notices of the beaver,
remark on the absence of any mention of
such an animal in the Scottish public records.
This, however, is an error. In an
Act of David I. fixing the rate of custom-duties,
beavers' skins are mentioned among
the Scottish exports, along with those of
the fox, the weasel, the martin, the wild
cat, the ferret, &amp;c.&mdash;"Of Peloure.&mdash;Of a

&amp;c., (Act. Parl. Scot. vol. i. p. 303.) Dr.
Neill has pointed out the interesting fact,
that the Scottish Highlanders still retain a
peculiar Gaelic name for the beaver, <i>Dobran</i>
<i>losleathan</i>, the broad-tailed otter. By the
Welsh it is called <i>Llosdlydan</i>, and Pennant
refers to waters in the principality still bearing
the name of the Beaver Lake.</p></div>

than silver, and indeed there are several
places in Scotland where there has been
much digging for gold. I have had the
curiosity to consider the nature of them, and
always found them just the same with those
the Emperor has on the borders of Hungary,
at two places, Nitria and Presburg. Those,
like ours, consist of a vein or stratum of
sand and gravel, which being brought up
some fathoms from below ground, and
washed, produce gold in very small particles."&mdash;Sir
John Clerk to Mr. Gale, August
6, 1732; <i>Biblo. Topog. Brit.</i> vol. ii. p. 299.
</p>
<p>
In the <i>Miscellanea Scotica</i>, printed in 1710,
various notices of the ancient working of
gold in Scotland occur. Pieces of gold,
mixed with spar and other substances,
weighing thirty ounces, are described among
the fruits of the Laughain and Phinland
mines. See also Pennant's Tour, App. x.
vol. iii. for a curious account "of the gold
mines of Scotland."

<p>
The introduction of the metals into southern
Europe in ancient times appears to have
borne no analogy to that in the north. Gold
was not used in the Roman coinage till
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 207, sixty-two years after the adoption
of a silver coinage. So, too, in the records
of sacred history, Abraham weighed unto
Ephron 400 shekels of silver, current money
with the merchant. The earliest notice of
gold used otherwise than for jewels and ornaments
only occurs in the reign of David,
when he purchased the threshing-floor of
Ornan for 600 shekels of gold by weight;
1 Chron. xxi. 25. Compare this with 2
Samuel xxiv. 24.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

THE METALLURGIC TRANSITION.</h3>


<p>In the earliest glimpse we are able to catch of the British Isles
with the dawning light of historic records, we learn of them as already
celebrated for their mineral wealth. So long, however, as Britain
retained its vast tracts of natural forests, and was only occupied by
thinly scattered nomade tribes, the tin mines of Cornwall, and the
foreign trade which they invited to the southern shores of the island,
might reward the toil and sagacity of the ancient Cornubii or other
primitive colonists of Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, without exercising
any perceptible influence on neighbouring tribes, or being known
to the remoter dwellers beyond the Solway and the Tyne. The spoils
of war, more probably than any peaceful interchange of commodities,
would first introduce the bronze weapons imported into Cornwall to
the knowledge of the northern tribes. But the superiority of the
sword and spear of metal over the old lance of flint or bone would
speedily be appreciated, and we accordingly find abundant traces of
one of the first elements of civilisation, viz., an interchange of commodities
and the importation of foreign manufactures, having accompanied
the advent of the Bronze Period. The rude aboriginal Briton
no longer confined his aim in the chase to the supply of his own
table and simple wardrobe. The Ph&#339;nicians traded to Britain for its
furs as well as its metals, and for these the products of a wider district
than the tin country would be required. The Caledonian hunter
would learn to hoard up the skins won in the chase, to barter with
them for the coveted sword and spear of bronze,&mdash;and thus the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
elements of civilisation would precede the direct knowledge of the
metallurgic arts.</p>

<p>The advent of the Bronze Period, however, cannot be held to have
been fairly introduced until the native Caledonian had learned, at
least to melt the metals, and to mould the weapons and implements
which he used, if not to quarry and smelt the ores which abound in
his native hills. The progress consequent on the indirect introduction
of the metals would speedily create new wants and the desire
for modifications and improvements on the implements of foreign
manufacture. The demands on his sagacity and skill would increase
with the gradual progress in intelligence and civilisation consequent
on the new impulses brought into operation; and thus would the arts
of the smith and the jeweller be superinduced on the originally barbarian
devices of the Caledonian. Once introduced, by whatever
means, he was not slow to improve on the lessons furnished in the
novel art; and while, with a pertinacious adherence to ancient models
singularly characteristic of primitive races, we find implements and
personal ornaments of the modern Scottish Highlander not greatly
differing from those of fully ten centuries ago, we also find the natives
of isolated districts, beyond the reach of changing influences, practising
the ingenious arts of this remote period when every man was
his own armourer and goldsmith.</p>

<p>It needs not either the authority of revelation, or the demonstrations
of ethnology, to prove that God has made of one blood all that
dwell upon the earth. Man, placed under the same conditions, everywhere
exhibits similar results. The ancient Stone Period of Assyria
and Egypt resembles that of its European successor, and that again
finds a nearly complete parallel in the primitive remains of the valley
of the Mississippi, and in the modern arts of the barbarous Polynesians.
So, too, with the higher state which succeeds this. The characteristics
of the early Bronze Period are long since familiar to us.
Milton, who accords equally stinted honours to Mulciber and to Mammon,
by whose suggestion taught, men</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ransack'd the centre, and with impious hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rifled the bowels of their mother earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For treasures better hid,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>refers to the introduction of the metallurgic arts as first among those
great sources of change which the Archangel Michael makes known
to Adam when exhibiting to him the future destiny of his seed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
knowledge of working in metals is there also introduced in contrast
to the simpler arts of the pastoral state, and as the chief source of
social progress with all its accompanying development of luxury
and crime. On one side Adam sees the shepherds' huts and grazing
herds;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In other part stood one who, at the forge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had melted, (whether found where casual fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From under ground,) the liquid ore he drained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into fit moulds prepared, from which he formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First his own tools, then what might else be wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fusil, or graven in metal."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Amid the highly artificial results of modern civilisation we might
find some difficulty in conceiving of such a social state, in which considerable
taste and ingenuity were displayed in the forging of arms
and tools, and in the manufacture of personal ornaments. But not
only are we able to compare the results of the division of labour
with the fruits of such isolated skill, in races only now beginning to
develop these first elements of civilisation; we can also look upon
the living representatives of the Caledonian at the dawn of his
historic era. Dr. Layard, in describing a visit to an ancient copper
mine in the Tiyari Mountains, remarks,&mdash;"In these mountains, particularly
in the heights above Lizan, and in the valley of Berwari,
mines of iron, lead, copper, and other minerals, abound. Both the
Kurds and the Chaldæans make their own weapons and implements
of agriculture, and cast bullets for their rifles&mdash;collecting the ores
which are scattered on the declivities, or brought down by the torrents."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
This affords a parallel modern picture of such a state of
society as that we have to conceive of in the early dawn of the
British Bronze Period. Martin, in his description of the Western
Isles, written at the commencement of the eighteenth century, remarks
of the islanders,&mdash;"When they travel on foot the plaid is
tied on the breast with a bodkin of bone or wood, just as the spina
worn by the Germans, according to the description of Tacitus." He
then furnishes a detailed account of the ancient dress, even then becoming
rare, and of the breast-buckle or brooch, of silver or brass,
which appears to have formed, from the very earliest times, the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>favourite personal ornament of both sexes. "I have seen some of the
former," says he, "of an hundred marks value: it was broad as any
ordinary pewter plate, the whole curiously engraven with various
animals, &amp;c. There was a lesser buckle, which was worn in the
middle of the larger, and about two ounces weight. It had in the
centre a large piece of crystal, or some finer stone, and this was set
all round with several stones of a lesser size."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The Rev. John Lane
Buchanan, visiting these islands nearly a century later, found the
same customs unchanged, and the primitive metallurgic arts of the
ingenious Hebrideans not greatly in advance of the modern Asiatic
Kurds. This writer remarks of the females,&mdash;"All of them wear a
small plaid, a yard broad, called <i>guilechan</i>, about their shoulders,
fastened by a large brooch. The brooches are generally round, and of
silver, if the wearer be in tolerable circumstances; if poor, the brooches,
being either circular or triangular, are of baser metal and modern date.
The first kind has been worn time immemorial even by the ladies.
The married women bind up their hair with a large pin into a knot
on the crown of their heads."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The same writer thus describes the
practice of every necessary art and trade by the simple islanders:&mdash;"It
is very common to find men who are tailors, shoemakers, stocking-weavers,
coopers, carpenters, and sawyers of timber. Some of them
employ the plane, the saw, the adze, the wimble, and they even groove
the deals for chests. They make hooks for fishing, cast metal buckles,
brooches, and rings for their favourite females."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> They were, in fact,
at that very recent period practising nearly the same arts as we may
trace out at a time when the Ph&#339;nician traders were still seeking the
harbours of Cornwall, and exchanging the manufactures of Carthage,
and perhaps of Tyre, for the products of the English mines. A no
less unquestionable proof of the unchanging character of the Celtic
arts is to be found in the fact that the ornamentation, not only on
many of the old Highland brooches and drinking horns, but invariably
employed in decorating the handle of the Highland dirk and knife,
down to the last fatal struggle of the clans on Culloden Moor which
abruptly closed the tradition of many centuries, is exactly the same
interlaced knotwork which we are familiar with on the most ancient
class of sculptured standing stones in Scotland. The annexed figure
of a Highland powder-horn of the seventeenth century is from one in
the possession of Mr. James Drummond, bearing inscribed on it the
initials and date, G. R. 1685. The triple knot, so common on early
Scottish and Irish relics that it has been supposed to have been used
as a symbol of the Trinity, is no less frequently introduced on the
Highland targets and brooches of last century, and is shewn along
with other interlaced ornaments, on an example of the latter introduced
in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/image221.jpg" width="582" height="295" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the theory of the introduction of metallurgic arts assumed
here, not altogether without evidence, it is not requisite that we
should conceive of the aboriginal Caledonians disturbed by the invasion
of foreign tribes armed with weapons scarcely less strange to
them than those with which the Spanish discoverers astonished the
simple natives of the New World. The changes, however, already
noted in the forms and modes of sepulture, the abandonment of the
long barrow, the introduction of cremation, of the sitting or folded
posture of the dead with the correspondingly abbreviated cist, and of
a uniform and defined direction of laying the dead, are all suggestive
of the probable intrusion of new races in earlier as well as in
later times. The facilities afforded by the more pliable metal tools
would speedily work no less remarkable changes on the mansions of
the living than on the sepulchres of the dead. The subterranean
weem would give place to the wooden structure, which the new arts
rendered at once a more convenient and simpler style of architecture;
while the inroads on the forests which such changes led to would necessitate
the clearing of the neighbouring lands preparatory to the
extended labours of the agriculturist. To the same cause also we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
may probably trace the origin of many of those extensive tracts of
bog and peat-moss which still encumber the limited level areas of
Scotland. The wasteful profusion of the natives of a thinly peopled
country would lead to the destruction of the forests with little heed
to aught but the supply of their own immediate wants. In the
extensive mosses of Kincardine and Blair-Drummond, which have
yielded such valuable archæological relics, when the surface of the
underlying clay was exposed by the removal of the moss, it was in many
places covered with trees, chiefly oak and birch, of a great size. These
were found lying in all directions beside their roots, which continued
firm in the ground in their natural position; and from impressions
still visible it was evident that they had been cut with an axe or some
similar instrument.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The like discoveries in other Scottish mosses
prove their origin from the same wasteful inroads of early times.</p>

<p>The occupants of the country at this period were necessarily
isolated tribes and clans, with no common interest, and little peaceful
intercourse. The arts were therefore practised as in their primeval
dawn described by Milton, when the artist formed</p>

<p class="center">"First his own tools, then what might else be wrought."
</p>

<p>Among all the varied primitive relics which have been from time
to time discovered, both in Scotland and other countries of northern
Europe, none exceed in interest the stone and bronze moulds
in which the earliest tools and weapons of the native metallurgist were
formed. They have been found in Scotland, England, Ireland, and
in the Channel Islands, exhibiting much diversity of form, and various
degrees of ingenuity and fitness for the purpose in view. Some
of them are of bronze, and highly finished, examples of which from
the British Museum are engraved in the Archæological Journal,
(vol. iv. p. 336,) in <i>Plate</i> VII. vol. v. of the Archæologia, and elsewhere.
If the account, however, furnished by Warburton to Stukely
may be relied upon, such objects are by no means rare. According
to him, a bushel of celts, each inclosed in a brass mould or case, was
found in 1719, at Brough, in the Humber. Mr. Worsaae refers to another
example of a number of bronzes found in Mecklenburg, accompanied
by the moulds in which they were cast, together with pieces
of unwrought metal; and similar bronze celt-moulds have been discovered
at various times in different parts of France. In the Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland there are casts of a pair of
large and very perfect bronze celt-moulds, of unusual size and peculiar
form, found at Theville, Arrondissement de Cherbourg.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 637px;">
<img src="images/image223.jpg" width="637" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Celt-Moulds, Ross-shire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But still more interesting are the ruder stone moulds, in some of
which we may trace the first efforts of the aborigines of the Stone
Period to adapt the materials with which they were familiar to the
novel arts of the metallurgist. This is particularly observable in
a mould-stone preserved in the Belfast Museum. It is polygonal in
form, and exhibits upon four of its surfaces indented moulds for axe-heads
of the simplest class. In this example there is no reason
to believe that any corresponding half was used to complete the
mould. The melted metal was simply poured into the indented surface,
and left to take shape by its equilibrium on the exposed surface.
Weapons formed in this way may frequently be detected, while others,
full of air-holes, and roughly granulated on the surface, appear to have
been made in the still simpler mould formed by an indentation in
sand. Others of the stone moulds have consisted of pairs, like those
of bronze. A very curious example of this description was found a
few years since in the Isle of Anglesea, and is engraved in the Archæological
Journal.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> It is a cube of hone-stone, nine inches and a quarter
in length, by four inches in breadth at its widest extremity. Each of
the four sides is indented for casting different weapons: two varieties
of spear, a lance or arrow-head, and a celt with two loops. Only the
one stone was found, but another corresponding one is obviously requisite,
by means of which four complete moulds would be obtained.
At the Congress of the Archæological
Institute, held
at Salisbury in 1849, the
temporary Museum contained
a mould of serpentine,
found in Dorsetshire,
designed for casting spear-heads,
and another of granite,
found near Amesbury
in Wiltshire, intended to
cast ornamented celts of
two sizes. Of the same class are two pairs of celt-moulds recently discovered
in the parish of Rosskeen, Ross-shire. The site of this interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>ing
discovery is about four miles inland, on the north side of the Cromarty
Frith, on a moor which the proprietor is reclaiming from the
wild waste, and restoring once more to the profitable service of man.
In the progress of this good work abundant evidence demonstrated
the fact, that the same area
from which the accumulated
vegetable moss of many
centuries is now being removed,
had formed the scene
of a busy, intelligent, and
industrious population ere
the first growth of this barren
produce indicated its
abandonment to solitude and
sterility. Near to the spot where the moulds were discovered there
stood till recently a large sepulchral cairn; and in forming a road
through the moss several cists were exposed containing human bones
and cinerary urns. Amid these evidences of ancient population the
two pairs of moulds were discovered, at a depth of only sixteen inches
from the surface. They are very perfect, and are composed of a hard
and very close-grained stone. One pair is notched and perforated
through both moulds, so as to admit of their being exactly fitted and
tied together for casting. Close to the spot where
they were discovered there was also disclosed
the remains of a rude inclosure or building of
stone, containing a bed of ashes and scoriæ; so
that here no doubt had been the forge of the
primitive metallurgist, from whence, perhaps,
the natives of an extensive district obtained
their chief supplies of weapons and tools. These
Scottish moulds give evidence both of taste and
ingenuity. In one of them is also a matrix for
forming a smaller implement, the use of which
is not easy to determine, while both the celts
are large and elegant in form. The woodcut
represents one of the celts cast from the mould, which measures fully
five inches long.</p>

<p>In most cases, however, it may be assumed that the earliest weapons
of metal were furnished, as the modern sportsman casts his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
bullets, by each warrior or craftsman becoming his own smith and
founder; and when we consider the slow and tedious process indispensable
for the completion of the stone hammer or lance-head of
flint, we may readily perceive that it would be from the scarcity of
the metals and not from any preference for primitive and more familiar
arts, that the Briton of the transition-period continued to use the
weapons of his fathers, or intermingled them with the more efficient
ones which the new art supplied. Still it was probably long before
he overcame the difficulty of casting metal in metal, and learned to
model and cast his mould instead of laboriously cutting it from stone.</p>

<p>In these, as in other stages of improvement, we detect, as it were,
the old tide-marks in the progress of civilisation. The rude chip-axe
improves into the highly polished wedge and celt; this in its turn
gives way to the rude sand-cast axe, or to the similar weapon moulded
in the indented stone. The celt and spear-head follow, gracefully
formed and looped in the double mould of stone or bronze. The taste
of the more experienced metallurgist also finds room for the exercise
of the decorative arts, and transfers to the bronze implements the
incised and chevron patterns which were first introduced on his vessels
of unbaked clay. Still further evidences of progress will come under
our notice, showing the extent to which civilisation had advanced before
the late and more familiar metal superseded the works of bronze.</p>

<p>In the romantic outskirts of the old Scottish capital some of the
most remarkable evidences of the abundant remains of this era have
been discovered. Reference has been made in a former chapter to the
finding of stone cists and cinerary urns as the modern city extended
over the suburban fields which lay beyond the old North Loch. Towards
the close of the eighteenth century, when the spirit of agricultural
improvement, which has been productive of such important
results to Scotland, was beginning to take effect, the use of marl as
a valuable manure was advocated and practised with a zeal no less
wide spread and enthusiastic than has resulted in our own day from
the discovery of the Guano Islands of the Pacific. One of the most
zealous of these Scottish agriculturists was Sir Alexander Dick of
Prestonfield, whose estate is bounded on the north by the romantic
Duddingstone Loch, which there separates it from the ancient royal
demesne of Holyrood Palace. In 1775 he constructed a canal, and
prepared a couple of flat-bottomed boats, with the requisite dredging
machinery attached to them. These were set afloat on the loch, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
their projector thus describes some of the most interesting results of
his labours in a letter communicated to the Earl of Buchan, the
founder of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, shortly after its
institution in 1780.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the third year of my progress in dragging successfully great quantities of
marl, now and then in the middle of the lake I met with large fragments of
deer's horns of an uncommon magnitude. As my operations were proceeding
northward, about one hundred and fifty yards from the verge of the lake next
the King's Park, the people employed in dredging in places deeper than usual,
after having removed the first surfaces of fat blackish mould, got into a bed of
shell marl from five to seven feet deep, from which they brought up in the collecting
leather bag a very weighty substance, which when examined as it was thrown
into the marl boat, was a heap of swords, spears, and other lumps of brass, mixed
with the purest of the shell marl. Some of the lumps of brass seemed as if half
melted; and my conjecture is that there had been upon the side of the hill, near
the lake, some manufactory for brass arms of the several kinds for which there
was a demand."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p></div>

<p>Rarely has a more interesting discovery been made, or one on an
equally extensive scale, illustrative of the Scottish Bronze Period. Some
of the most perfect and beautiful of these ancient weapons were presented
to His Majesty George III.; others, doubtless also among the
best specimens, were retained as family heirlooms, some of which
were afterwards given to Sir Walter Scott;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> but the remainder, including
upwards of fifty pieces of swords, spear-heads, and fragments of
other weapons, most of them more or less affected by fire, were presented
to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and formed the very first
donation towards the founding of their valuable collection of national
antiquities. The royal gifts and nearly all the family heirlooms have
disappeared, but the whole of those presented to the Society still
remain in their Museum. The swords are of the usual leaf-shaped
form, with perforated handles, to which horn or wood has been attached.
Some of the larger broken spear-heads have been pierced
with a variety of ornamental perforations, and in addition to these
there were bronze rings and staples, similar to those found on various
occasions with other remains of the same period. The accompanying
woodcut represents one of these, measuring three inches in diameter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>along with a larger one in the Scottish Museum, which was found along
with several bronze celts and swords, on the estate of Kilkerran, Ayrshire,
in 1846, and more closely resembles the examples most frequently
met with both in style and dimensions.</p>

</div>

<p>The discovery of gigantic deer's horns and fragments of others along
with the weapons and masses of melted bronze, would seem to add to
the probability that some considerable manufacture of such weapons
had been carried on, at some remote period, on the margin of the loch,
and that these were collected
for supplying them
with handles. But other
relics besides those which
speak to us of the ingenious
arts of the metallurgist,
were dredged, along with the
shell marl, from the bottom
of the loch. "There were
likewise brought up," says
Sir Alexander Dick, "out
of the same place with
these brass arms, several human skulls and bones, which had been
undoubtedly long preserved in the shell marl, which Dr. Monro and I
examined very accurately, and by their very black colour we concluded
they had been immersed in the marl for an immense time."
Unfortunately neither the skulls nor the horns have been preserved.
In this, as in a thousand other instances, we seek in vain for the
minuter details that would confer so much value on the vague glimpses
of archæological truths scattered through old periodicals, Statistical
Accounts, and other unsatisfactory sources of information. Here
we might say, with tolerable confidence, lay the manufacturer beside
his tools. It becomes an interesting question to know if the deer's
horns exhibited marks of artificial cutting, as this would go far to
prove their use in the completion of the weapons beside which they
lay, and might further help us in forming an opinion as to how they
were applied. But still more, we would seek to learn if these skulls
corresponded with either of the old types of the tumuli, or if they exhibited
the later Celtic type intermediate between the lengthened and
shortened oval, and were characterized by superior cerebral development
such as their progress in the arts might lead us to expect. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
possible that some record of these facts has been preserved, since the
skulls were submitted to one of the most distinguished anatomists of
his day; but I have failed to discover any clue to such, after inquiries
submitted both to Dr. Alexander Monro, and to Professor Goodsir
who now fills the Chair of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Bronze Sword. Arthur Seat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fully seventy years after the marl-dredgers had brought to light
the remarkable primitive relics buried beneath the alluvium at the
bottom of Duddingstone Loch, the Honourable Board of Commissioners
of Her Majesty's Woods and Forests determined on constructing
a carriage-way round the neighbouring Royal Park, which includes
both Arthur Seat and Salisbury Crags. In the progress of the
necessary operations for carrying this plan into execution, and while
the workmen were excavating the soil immediately
above the singular group of basaltic columns popularly
styled "Samson's Ribs," they uncovered
a sepulchral deposit containing a cinerary urn,
which was unfortunately broken to fragments by
a stroke of the workman's shovel. Further to
the eastward two, at least, and probably more
bronze celts of large size were found, along with a
small drinking-cup, engraved on a subsequent page.
Still further to the east, almost directly above Duddingstone Loch&mdash;where
the magnificent "Queen's Drive" is carried along the steep
side of the hill at an elevation of nearly 300 feet above the level of the
neighbouring loch&mdash;two most beautiful and perfect leaf-shaped bronze
swords were dug up, in a bed of vegetable charcoal, but with no remains
which would indicate its having been a sepulchral deposit. The
largest of the two swords measures 26&frac14; inches long; the other 24&frac34;
inches by 1&frac34; inches in greatest breadth. In other respects they entirely
agree, resembling in figure the usual form of this graceful
weapon, as will be observed from the annexed engraving of one of
them. The swords and the largest of the bronze celts, figured above,
are now in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
celt and the cup are in my own possession; and as they were obtained
from an Irish labourer, who shewed no little reluctance to be
questioned, it is extremely probable that these are but a portion of
the valuable treasures disclosed in the course of the excavations.
How many more may lie interred for the gratification and instruction
of future generations covered only by a foot or two of soil!</p>

<p>It naturally becomes a question of considerable interest to us,&mdash;Are
these weapons, of beautiful and varied forms, the product of native
genius and skill? or were they brought hither by foreign conquerors,
to remain only as the evidences of national inferiority in arts and
arms? The question is one which no Briton can deem worthless;
albeit we do not esteem ourselves the pure lineal descendants of the
Allophylian aborigines, or of the primitive Celtæ, but, on the contrary,
are content to derive our peculiar modern national characteristics
as the product of mingled races of Picts, Scots, Romans, Tungrians
and other barbarian legionary colonists, Norwegians, Danes,
Anglo-Saxons, and Normans.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Such are indeed the strange and diverse
elements which make up the genealogy of the modern Scot. Nevertheless,
his nationality is not the less strong because he derives his
inheritance from so many sources; nor is his interest lessened in the
aboriginal root. A very simple theory has heretofore sufficed for the
classification of all Scottish, and, until very recently, of all British
antiquities. Whatever was rude and barbarous, such as unhewn
standing stones and monolithic circles, stone hammers and axes, and
flint arrows, were native and Druidical; whatever manifested skill,
invention, or any progress in the arts, was either Ph&#339;nician, Roman,
or Danish! Britain, it was tacitly assumed, was sunk in the lowest
state of barbarism, until humanized by the bloody missionaries of
Roman civilisation. Such ignorant assumption will no longer suffice.</p>

<p>Mr. Worsaae adopts an era extending over about eleven centuries
for the continuation of the Danish bronze period. From geological
evidence he arrives at the conclusion, which is not improbable, that
bronze weapons and implements were in use fully five centuries before
the Christian era. But that the Archaic Period continued so long
after it, when the neighbouring countries to the south were long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
familiar with the common and more useful metal, and when the Norwegians,
who, it is acknowledged, appear never to have known a
bronze period, were already taking their position among the Scandinavian
nations, preparatory to making their piratical descents on
the British shores, seems altogether improbable and opposed to established
truths.</p>

<p>No description furnished either by Julius Cæsar or any later classical
writer, of the weapons used by the native Britons of the first or
second century, in any degree corresponds with the familiar form of
the bronze sword so frequently found in the earlier tumuli.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Tacitus
describes the Caledonians as "a powerful warlike nation, using swords
large and blunt at the point (<i>sine mucrone</i>) and targets wherewith they
skilfully defend themselves against the Roman missiles." The bronze
leaf-shaped sword in no respect corresponds with this. It is a short
and small, though formidable weapon, and is not only designed for
thrusting rather than striking with,&mdash;as a heavy, blunt-pointed sword
could alone be used,&mdash;but was evidently adapted for a warfare in which
the chief tactics of the swordsman consisted in the bold thrust; since
no example of a bronze sword has ever been found with a guard, that
simple and most natural contrivance for defending the hand from the
downward stroke of the foe. With such unmistakable evidence before
us, the conclusion seems inevitable that the era of the bronze
sword had passed away ere the hardy Caledonian encountered the
invading legions of Rome. Nevertheless, while there is abundant
evidence of the native manufacture of the articles of the Bronze
Period, there are no less manifest traces of considerable intercourse
throughout Europe during this era, from the near resemblance discoverable
in all the bronze articles. The British bronze sword bears
a general likeness to those not only of Denmark, but of Gaul, Germany,
and even of Italy and Greece; but it has also its peculiar
characteristics. It is broader and shorter than the Danish bronze
sword, swelling out more towards the middle, so as to suggest the term
<i>leaf-shaped</i>, by which it is now distinguished. A very remarkable
guide to the probable era of such weapons in the south of Europe
is furnished by a comparison of some specimens of Hellenic fictile
art with a beautiful vase discovered at Vulci by the Prince of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>Canino, and described in the Archæologia<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> by Mr. Samuel Birch.
The same subject occurs on three vases, and has been supposed to
represent the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles. On one, a Vulcian
hydria of archaic style, a naked and bearded combatant bears a leaf-shaped
sword without a guard. On a second, a cylix of later style
from the Canino Collection, the combatants are armed with leaf-shaped
swords, but with guards; while on the beautiful vase which
Mr. Birch refers to as a specimen of Greek art contemporary with the
Orestes of Æschylus, the same scene occurs, but the assailant has
substituted for the primitive weapon a straight two-edged sword of
modern form. Such comparisons cannot be deemed without their
value; but independent of these, the variations in the bronze relics
of the same type suffice to prove that neither the British antiquities
of bronze were brought from Denmark, nor the Danish ones from
Britain. The handles of the British weapon especially appear to have
been always of wood or horn, while many are met with in Denmark
with bronze handles, ornamented with a peculiar pattern, and even
sometimes inlaid with gold, but all invariably without a guard.</p>

<p>Among an interesting collection of bronze weapons discovered
near Bilton, Yorkshire, in 1848, parts of two broken swords were
found, on which Mr. C. Moore Jessop makes the following observations:&mdash;"The
portions of swords have each been broken off a few
inches down the blade, thus leaving the metallic part of the handle
entire; which has been covered on both sides with horn or some
similar substance, affixed by rivets, which having become loose have
allowed the horn to move slightly each way, thus wearing away the
metal. They have left evident traces of the shape of the hilt, and
likewise prove the weapons to have been long in use."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Gordon engraves
a fine bronze sword, twenty-six inches long, which was found
near Carinn, on the line of the wall of Antoninus Pius, and deposited
in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh. Its most remarkable feature
is its handle, which is of brass, but after examining the original, I am
satisfied that the latter is a modern addition.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>It is especially worthy of note in relation to the makers and owners
of these swords, that the handles are invariably small. One of the
most marked ethnological characteristics of the pure Celtic race, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>contrast to the Teutonic, is the small hands and feet; a feature so
very partially affected by the mingling of Teutonic with the old Celtic
blood of Scotland, that many of the older basket-hilted Highland
swords will scarcely admit the hand of a modern Scotsman of ordinary
size. This has been observed in various primitive races, and is noted
by Mr. Stephens as characteristic of the ancient temple builders of
Yucatan. In describing the well-known symbol of the <i>red hand</i>, first
observed at Uxmal, Mr. Stephens remarks,&mdash;"Over a cavity in the
mortar were two conspicuous marks, which afterwards stared us in the
face in all the ruined buildings of the country. They were the prints
of a red hand, with the thumb and fingers extended, not drawn or
painted, but stamped by the living hand, the pressure of the palm
upon the stone. There was one striking feature about these hands&mdash;they
were exceedingly small. Either of our own spread over and
completely hid them."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> This is another of the physical characteristics
of the earlier races well worthy of further note. While the delicate
small hand and foot are ordinarily looked upon as marks of high-breeding,
and are justly regarded as pertaining to the perfect beauty
of the female form, the opposite are found among the masculine
distinctions of the pure Teutonic races,&mdash;characteristic of their essentially
practical and aggressive spirit,&mdash;and are frequently seen most
markedly developed in the skilful manipulator and ingenious mechanician.</p>

<p>The spear-heads of this period are also marked by national distinctive
features; the exceedingly common British form, for example,
with loops to secure it to the shaft, being unknown in Denmark, and a
variety of pierced heads common in Scotland and Ireland being rarely
or never found in England. So it is with other varieties of weapons,
implements, and personal ornaments: some which are common in
Denmark are unknown here, or assume different forms; others with
which we are familiar are unknown to the Danish archæologist; while
both are in like manner distinguished from those of Germany, France,
and the south of Europe. The distinctive peculiarities may indeed
be most aptly compared to those which mark the various national
developments of medieval art, and give to each an individuality of
character without impairing the essential characteristics of the style.
The extent of international communication was only so much greater
and more direct in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, than in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
older centuries before the Christian era, as to produce a more rapid
interchange of thought and experience.</p>

<p>This national individuality, accompanying such remarkable correspondence
to a common type, may therefore be assumed as justifying
the conclusion that some considerable intercourse must have prevailed
among the different races of Europe during that remote period to
which we refer; and hence we are led to assume an additional evidence
of early civilisation, while at the same time no sufficient proof
appears to point to such a sudden transition as necessarily to lead to
the conclusion that the bronze relics belong entirely to a new people.
On the contrary, the evidence of slow transition is abundantly manifest.
The metallurgic arts, and the models by which their earliest
application was guided, were in all probability introduced by a new
race, who followed in the wake of the older wanderers from the same
Eastern cradle-land of the human race. But the rude stone moulds,
the sand-cast celts and palstaves, and the relics of the primitive forges
in which they were wrought, all point to aboriginal learners slowly
acquiring the new art, while perhaps its originators were introducing
those works of beautiful form and great finish and delicacy of workmanship,
which the antiquary of the eighteenth century could ascribe
to none but the Roman masters of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Worsaae remarks, after pointing out the correspondence, in many
respects, between the bronze relics of Denmark and those of other
countries of Europe, these "prove nothing more than that certain
implements and weapons had the same form among different nations."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
And again, "from these evidences it follows that the antiquities
belonging to the Bronze Period, which are found in the different
countries of Europe, can neither be attributed exclusively to the Celts,
nor to the Greeks, Romans, Ph&#339;nicians, Sclavonians, nor to the
Teutonic tribes. They do not belong to any one people, but have
been used by the most different nations at the same stage of civilisation;
and there is no historical evidence strong enough to prove that
the Teutonic people were in that respect an exception. The forms
and patterns of the various weapons, implements, and ornaments, are
so much alike, because such forms and patterns are the most natural
and the most simple. As we saw in the Stone Period how people at
the lowest stage of civilisation, by a sort of instinct, made their stone
implements in the same shape, so we see now, in the first traces of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>higher civilisation, that they exhibit in the mode of working objects
of bronze a similar general resemblance."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> But are the forms and
patterns thus natural and simple? This argument, which abundantly
satisfies us as to the universal correspondence of the majority of tools
and weapons of the Stone Period, entirely fails when thus applied to
the works of the Bronze Period. The former are in most cases of
the simplest and most rudimentary character: the perforated oblong
stone for a hammer, the pointed flint for an arrow-head, and the
longer edged and pointed flint for a knife or spear. Human intelligence,
in its most barbarous state, suggests such simple devices with
a universality akin to the narrower instincts of the lower animals.
They are, in truth, mathematically demonstrable as the simplest
shapes. But the beauty and variety of form and decoration in the productions
of the Bronze Period bring them under a totally different
classification. They are works of art, and though undoubtedly exhibiting
an indefiniteness peculiarly characteristic of its partial development,
are scarcely less marked by novel and totally distinct forms
than the products of the many different classic, medieval, or modern
schools of design. The form of the leaf-shaped sword, indeed, is unsurpassed
in beauty by any later offensive weapon. We are justified,
therefore, in assuming that the general correspondence traceable
throughout the productions of the European Bronze Period, affords
evidence of considerable international intercourse having prevailed;
while the peculiarities discoverable on comparing the relics found in
different countries of Europe compel us to conclude that they are the
products of native art, and not manufactures diffused from some
common source. We have already traced them as pertaining to the
infantile era of Greece, and may yet hope to find them among the
indications of primitive Asiatic population, thereby supplying a new
line of evidence in illustration of the north-western migration of the
human race, and probably also a means of approximation towards the
date of the successive steps by which the later nomades advanced
towards the coasts of the German Ocean.</p>

<p>In the former section numerous instances have been referred to of
the discovery of canoes belonging, by indisputable evidence, to the
Primeval Period. One example, at least, has been recorded of a ship
apparently belonging to the succeeding era of bronze, and which, both
in size and mode of construction, amply accords with the assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
characteristics of the more advanced period, and with the idea of
direct intercourse with the continent of Europe. "In this town,"
(Stranraer,)says the old historian of Galloway, writing in 1683, "the
last year, while they were digging a water-gate for a mill, they lighted
upon a ship a considerable distance from the shore, unto which
the sea at the highest spring tides never comes. It was transversely
under a little bourn, and wholly covered with earth a considerable
depth; for there was a good yard, with kail growing in it, upon
the one end of it. By that part of it which was gotten out, my informers,
who saw it, conjecture that the vessel had been pretty large;
they also tell me that the boards were not joined together after the
usual fashion of our present ships or barks, as also that it had nailes
of copper."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Here we find remarkable evidence of progress. The
rude arts of the aboriginal seaman, by which he laboriously hollowed
the oaken trunk and adapted it for navigating his native seas, have
been superseded by a systematic process of ship-building, in which
the metallic tools sufficed to hew and shape the planks as well as to
furnish the copper fastenings by which they were secured. Vessels
thus constructed were doubtless designed for wider excursions than
the navigation of native estuaries and inland seas; nor must we
assume, because the records of ancient history have heretofore concentrated
our interest on the countries bordering on the Mediterranean,
that therefore the German Ocean and the British seas were a waste of
unpeopled waters, save, perhaps, when some rude canoe, borne beyond
its wonted shelter on the coasts, timorously struggled to regain
the shore. Enough has already been advanced to disabuse us of the
fallacy, that where no annals of a people have been preserved nothing
worth chronicling can have existed.</p>

<p>Much will be gained if faith can be established in the fact, that
deeds worth recording were enacted in Britain in these old times when
no other chronicler existed but the bard who committed to tradition
his unwritten history, and the more faithful mourner who entrusted
to the grave the records of his reverence or his love. Faith is required
for the honest and zealous study of the subject; but with
this we doubt not that many links will be supplied which are still
wanting to complete the picture of the past. This much, however,
seems already established, that at a period long prior to the first cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>tury
of the Christian era the art of working in metals was introduced
into Britain, and gradually superseded the rude primitive implements
of stone. The intelligent British savage, supplied with this important
element of civilisation, wrought and smelted the ores, melted and
mixed the metals, formed moulds, and improved on early and imperfect
models, until he carried the art to such perfection that even now
we look upon his later bronze works with admiration, and are hard to
be persuaded that they are not the creations of Ph&#339;nician or Roman,
rather than of native British civilisation prior to the introduction of
letters.</p>

<p>How remote the origin of this transition-period of civilisation dates
we cannot as yet presume to say; but with our preconceived notions,
derived chiefly from an exclusively classical education, we are more apt
to err on the side of too modern than of too remote a date. Mr. Worsaae,
after discussing and rejecting the idea of a Roman origin for the bronze
relics of Denmark, adds,&mdash;"Nor in all probability have these bronzes
reached us from Greece, although, both with regard to their form and
ornaments, particularly the spiral ornaments, a greater similarity appears
to exist between those which occur in the north and those found
in the most ancient tombs of Greece. For independently of the fact,
that the latter have hitherto occurred but seldom, so that our knowledge
of them is extremely imperfect, they belong to so very remote
a period&mdash;1000 or 1400 years before the birth of Christ&mdash;that we can
by no means be justified in supposing that any active intercourse
then existed between countries so remote from each other."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But
why not? Active it might be, though indirect; or, what is equally
likely, both might derive their models from a common source&mdash;perhaps
Ph&#339;nician, the apparent source of Greek metallurgic art; perhaps
from the older regions of central Asia, whence both were sprung.
We see, at least, from evidence which appears to me incontrovertible,
that at a much more remote period a human population occupied the
British Isles; and we shall allow our judgments to be misled by very
fallacious reasoning if we conclude that they could not have attained
to any degree of civilisation at the period referred to, merely because
no notice of them occurs in the pages of classic writers. The Greeks
and Romans looked with contempt on all other nations. Partly from
this national pride, but still more perhaps from a want of that philological
talent peculiar to modern times, they gave little heed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>languages of their most civilized contemporaries, and looked on
their barbarian arts and manners with contempt. Yet among the
<i>barbarians</i> of the Greeks we must include the Egyptians, the Ph&#339;nicians,
and the Hebrews; even as we ourselves rank among the barbarians
of the modern Chinese, whose annals at most will tell of us as
a roving race who first appeared in history towards the end of the
seventeenth century!</p>

<p>The civilisation of the British Bronze Period does not appear to
have been of so active a nature as to have produced any very rapid
social changes. It did not break up the isolated tribes of Britain,
and unite them into kingdoms or associated states. Its material
element was never so abundant as to admit of any such great contemporaneous
development. It was rather such a change as might slowly
operate over many centuries; and that it did so is rendered most probable
by the many relics of it which still remain. The Toltecans and
Yucatecs of the New World achieved much in their Bronze Period
unknown to medieval Europe; nor is it altogether impossible that even
now, beyond the vast forests so recently explored by Mr. Stephens, a
native race may be found practising arts akin to those of Montezuma's
reign. Certain it is that the British Bronze Period was passing away
in the transition-state of a later era when the Roman galleys first
crossed the English Channel, and from the last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> we must
reckon backward up to that remote and altogether undetermined
era, when the elder Stone Period passed by slow transition into that
of Bronze.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

PRIMITIVE BRONZE.</h3>


<p>Among the various means of arriving at definite truths in relation
to primitive works in metal, that of chemical analysis has not been
lost sight of, and a number of ascertained results are now on record.
Before proceeding to examine in detail the relics of this second period,
it will be useful to glance at the bearings of this branch of scientific
evidence on the general question.</p>

<p>It may now be received as an established fact, that the manufactures
of this period consist entirely of bronze and not of brass&mdash;that
is, of an alloy of copper and tin, and not of copper and zinc; but also
including other metals, and especially a proportion of lead, in some
examples exceeding the quantity of tin present. Even among the
Romans we have abundant evidence that the alloy of copper and
zinc was rarely used, although it is now known to be both more economical,
and easier to work into a variety of forms. Mr. Worsaae,
after remarking on the resemblance observable among the weapons,
implements, and ornaments of bronze found in various countries, both
in the north and south of Europe, adds,&mdash;"They have all been cast in
moulds, and the metal is of the same composition&mdash;nine-tenths copper,
and one-tenth tin. From this there would be farther reason to
suppose that they all originated with one people."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> This country, as
has been already shewn, he elsewhere supposes may be England.
From a careful examination and comparison of the antiquities themselves,
however, the Danish archæologist is led to the conclusion that
the bronze objects were manufactured in the various countries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>Europe, where they are now found, and that only the metal was imported
from some common centre. The same idea appears at one
period to have been adopted by the Rev. Dr. Robinson, an Irish archæologist
still more distinguished for his devotion to astronomical
science than for his intelligent elucidation of antiquarian investigations;
but the results of more extended observation, communicated
by him to the Royal Irish Academy in 1848, shew that he was ultimately
led to a different conclusion. Minute examination of the bronzes
themselves will be found to throw fully as much doubt on the probability
of a common origin for the mixed metal, as for the weapons into
which it has been fashioned. The difference even in colour and texture
is very great, and in some cases still only imperfectly accounted for.
Many of the bronze weapons found both in Scotland and Ireland,
are of a bright yellow colour, like brass, or rather resembling gilded
metal; it does not tarnish, and, on analysis, is found to contain no
zinc. Others are more of a copper colour, also little liable to tarnish
or corrode; while a third quality, if polished, rapidly resumes a dark
and nearly black colour, and is frequently found covered with verd
antique. To the first of these the term <i>Celtic brass</i> is often applied,
though it is in common use for all the varieties of primitive
bronze. Analysis of these relics by no means bears out the idea of
any uniform system of combination of the pure metals, or of their
being derived from a single source in the form of bronze. The variations
in the proportionate admixture of the metals were indeed necessarily
confined within a limited range, especially in the manufacture of
weapons. It did not require any mutual intercourse between the old
Scandinavian and British armourer to teach them the most useful
combinations of the new alloy. If the sword or spear proved either
too ductile or too brittle for use, it would be consigned anew to the
furnace, with such additions to the mixed metals as experience must
soon suggest. The same would hold good even if we suppose that, as
Cæsar affirms, the Britons used imported bronze, (<i>ære utuntur importato</i>.)
Whether the tin and copper were mixed by Ph&#339;nician, Roman,
or British metallurgists, similar proportional combinations of the
two would necessarily be the result of experience. It will be seen,
however, that the "Celtic brass" of British archæologists is neither
invariably composed of exactly the same proportions of tin and copper,
nor even solely of these two metals.</p>

<p>One of the most elaborate and valuable reports published on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
subject is contained in a communication read to the Royal Society of
London, June 9, 1796, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions
of that year. It is entitled, "Observations on some metallic arms and
utensils, with experiments to determine their composition," by George
Pearson, M.D., F.R.S. His experiments were both analytic and synthetic,
and consequently enable us to trace the probable experience of
the primitive metallurgist, before he had ascertained the most useful
proportions of the metals for practical purposes. Copper, we know,
is not unfrequently found native in its metallic state, and fit for immediate
use. Tin, though never found in this state, occurs in England
in the same locality with the copper, and often near the surface. It
might, therefore, even accidentally be combined with the former
metal. The fact of the two possessing, when in combination, the
requisite hardness for domestic or warlike purposes which neither of
them has when alone, appears to have been ascertained at a very
remote period. In addition to this indispensable property, the combination
possesses the valuable qualities of being more readily fusible
and continuing longer in the fluid state. Hence the mixture of two
of the metals most readily accessible to the native Briton greatly facilitated
all his other operations.</p>

<p>The synthetic experiments of Dr. Pearson furnish the following results
applicable to the present argument:&mdash;The bronze relics submitted
to analysis and comparison consisted&mdash;1. of a lituus, or musical wind-instrument,
found in the river Witham, Lincolnshire, in 1768; 2. A
spear-head of the common unperforated form, "made of cast metal, as
appears from its rough surface, figure, texture, and grain.... It is
open grained almost as copper, and porous, as if made of bad metal,
of a blackish-brown or dark-grey colour;" 3. A sauce-pan, (Anglo-Roman
patella,) also made of cast metal, open grained, impressed on
the handle with a stamp, <span class="smcap">C. ARAT.</span>; 4. A bronze scabbard, with a sword
of iron within it, thought to be Danish; and, 5. Three celts, (Nos. 1
and 3, what we now term axe-heads, No. 2 an axe-shaped palstave,)
all found in the bed of the river Witham. In his comparative experiments
Dr. Pearson fused fifty grains of tin with 1000 grains of copper;
<i>i.e.</i>, one part of tin to twenty parts of copper. The result, when polished,
differed in shade of colour from that of the celt metals, being much
darker&mdash;a point not unworthy of note in determining some of the
characteristics of primitive bronze relics. Its fracture shewed a colour
inclining to the peculiar red of copper. One hundred grains of tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
united by fusion with 1500 grains of copper; <i>i.e.</i>, one part of the former
to fifteen parts of the latter, resembled the celt metals, Nos. 1 and 2 in
colour, polished surface, grain and brown colour of the fracture, the red
of the copper being no longer apparent. It was stronger than the
celt metals, but not so hard, while it was harder than the spear-head
and the patella. No very remarkable differences are observable in the
experiments of the combinations of twelve, ten, nine, and eight parts
of copper with one of tin. When, however, the copper is reduced to
seven parts to one of tin, the increase in hardness and brittleness becomes
very apparent, while the alloy is decidedly paler in colour. The
same characteristics were still more marked on successively reducing
the proportions of copper to seven, six, five, four, and three; and when
an alloy was made of two parts of copper with one part of tin, it
"was as brittle almost as glass." It is not difficult, from these results,
to imagine the process pursued by the old worker in bronze, who,
having ascertained that he could harden his copper by alloying it with
tin, would not fail to diminish the added quantities of the latter till
he had secured an efficient practical admixture for the purposes of
his manufacture, in which it is apparent, from the above results,
that no very great nicety of apportionment of the ingredients was
required. The most fit proportions for the manufacture of weapons
and tools Dr. Pearson considers to be one part of tin to nine parts
of copper.</p>

<p>The result of a comparison of numerous analyses of primitive bronze
relics will, I think, lead to the conclusion that their correspondence
is not greater than might be anticipated to arise from the experience
acquired by isolated workers, when dealing with the same metals,
with similar objects in view, while the frequent presence of other
metals besides tin and copper may, in the majority of cases, be accepted
as additional proof of the unsystematic processes of the old
metallurgist; though in some instances we may trace, in the adaptation
to a special purpose, the evidence of design.</p>

<p>The results of Dr. Pearson's analytic experiments are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Lituus</i> contained a little more than twelve per cent. of tin;
<i>i.e.</i>, about one part of tin to seven and a half parts of copper. Specific
gravity, (<i>before melting</i>,) 8.3.</p>

<p><i>The Spear-head</i>; fourteen per cent. of tin, or somewhat less than
one part of tin to six parts of copper; in addition to which it contained
the proportion of fifteen grains of silver in a troy pound of the
mixed metal. Specific gravity, 7.795.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Patella</i>; a little more than fourteen per cent. of tin, or about
one part of tin and six parts of copper. Specific gravity, 7.960.</p>

<p><i>Bronze Scabbard</i>; a little more than ten per cent. of tin, or about
one part of tin to nine parts of copper. Specific gravity, 8.5.</p>

<p><i>Celts</i>, Nos. 1 and 2; a little more than nine per cent. of tin, or
about one part of tin to ten parts of copper. Specific gravity, No. 1,
8.780; No. 2, 8.680; No. 3, a little more than twelve per cent. of tin,
or about one part of tin to seven and a half parts of copper. Specific
gravity, (<i>after melting</i>,) 8.854.</p>

<p>In the month of August 1816, some labourers employed in lowering
the road on the top of a small eminence, called Huckeridge Hill, near
Sawston, Cambridgeshire, discovered the remains of a human skeleton,
at the feet of which stood two large bronze vessels. On the left side
of the skeleton were also found an iron sword greatly corroded, and
fragments of a very coarse urn, half an inch in thickness. The rim
of the largest bronze vessel was ornamented with a row of bosses, indented
from the under side. Dr. Clarke, Professor of Mineralogy in
the University of Cambridge, subjected portions of the bronze to
analysis, and communicated the result to the Society of Antiquaries
of London. The conclusion he arrived at was, that they consisted of
88/100 of copper with 12/100 of tin, or about one part of tin to seven and a
half parts of copper. Dr. Clarke also assigns exactly the same proportions
of copper and tin as constituting the bronze coinage of Antoninus
Pius, and of his successor Marcus Aurelius; which it will be seen
correspond with those of the lituus and one of the celts analyzed by Dr.
Pearson. The process adopted by the former, however, in the chemical
analysis of those bronzes is much less satisfactory than that of Dr.
Pearson, as he appears to have assumed the absence of all other metals,
and sought only for copper and tin.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> A bronze sword, found in France,
proved on analysis to contain 87.47 parts of copper to 12.53 of tin in
every 100 parts, with a portion of zinc so small as not to be worth
noticing, or capable of affecting the bronze.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The analyses of various
specimens of antique bronze, including a helmet with an inscription,
found at Delphi, and now in the British Museum, some nails from the
Treasury of Atreus at Mycenæ, an ancient Corinthian coin, and a portion
of a breastplate or cuirass of exquisite workmanship, also in the
British Museum, are stated to have afforded about eighty-seven or
eighty-eight parts copper to about twelve or thirteen of tin per cent.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>In the communication of Dr. Robinson to the Royal Irish Academy,
previously referred to, he laid before that body a report of a most
valuable discovery made about eighteen years since in King's County.
It consisted of a large bronze vessel, which contained, in addition
to various relics acquired by the late Dean of St. Patrick's and
other individuals, thirteen litui or trumpets of bronze, the largest
having their seams rivetted; thirty-one bronze celts of different sizes;
twenty-nine spear-heads; three gouges; and thirty-one bells, believed
to be for sheep or cattle&mdash;all of bronze. The account of this remarkable
discovery had been reserved for sixteen years, owing to the strange
suspiciousness of the Irish peasants by whom it was found, who imposed
on the purchaser the promise of keeping the details secret
during their lives. The last of them died in the winter of 1848, and
then he felt himself at liberty to communicate the particulars which
Dr. Robinson laid before the Academy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The vessel, which is now in the collection of the Earl of Rosse, was found in
the townland marked Dooros Heath, in sheet 30 of the Ordnance Map of King's
County, near Whigsborough, in what appears from the description to have been a
piece of cut-out bog, about eighteen inches below the surface. It is composed of
two pieces neatly connected by rivets. The bronze of which the sheets are formed
possesses considerable flexibility, but is harder than our ordinary brass, and it must
have required high metallurgic skill to make them so thin and uniform. On the
other hand, it is singular that neither in this or any other bronze implements with
which I am acquainted, are there any traces of the art of soldering; if it might
be supposed objectionable in vessels exposed to heat, yet in musical instruments
this would not apply. Such vessels have often been found, but the contents of this
are peculiar. When discovered (without any cover) it seemed full of marl, on
removing which it was found to contain an assortment of the instruments which
may be supposed most in request among the rude inhabitants of such a country as
Ireland must have been at that early epoch.... It seems likely that the collection
was the stock of a travelling merchant, who, like the pedlar of modern times,
went from house to house provided with the commodities most in request, and it is
easily imagined that if entangled in a bog with so heavy a load, a man must relinquish
it.</p>

<p>"This is connected with another question, the source from which the ancient
world was supplied with the prodigious quantity of bronze arms and utensils which
we know to have existed. This caught my imagination many years since, and I
then analyzed a great variety of bronzes, with such uniform results that I supposed
this identity of composition was evidence of their all coming from the same manufactures.
Afterwards I found that the peculiar properties of the atomic compound
already referred to are sufficiently distinct to make any metallurgist who was engaged
in such a manufacture select it. It also appears to me more permanent in
the crucible."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Robinson states that this alloy, when used for weapons, is a
constant chemical compound containing fourteen equivalents of copper
and one of tin, or nearly eighty-eight parts of the former and
twelve of the latter by weight. But no account is given by him of
the process of analysis, and the results justify the supposition that in
these experiments, as in those of Dr. Clarke of Cambridge, he had assumed
the absence of all other metals, and sought only for copper and
tin.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Notwithstanding the opinions quoted above, Dr. Robinson
still inclines, on other grounds, to the conclusion that we are justified
in tracing the bronze to some common source, and this he conceives
to be the Ph&#339;nicians. In all the weapons and implements the points
are entire and sharp, and the edges unbroken. The spear-heads are
the most remarkable as specimens of workmanship. They are of
various sizes, and of great diversity of pattern, and also have their
points and edges perfect as if they had never been used. They prove,
as Dr. Robinson remarks, not only that the workmen who made them
were masters of the art of casting, but also that they possessed high
mechanical perceptions; their productions shewing a skilful adaptation
of the material to the end in view. These indications appear to
him to confirm the idea of their derivation from some foreign source.
"Yet," he also adds, "in many of them the colour of the bronze is
such as, at first sight, to excite a suspicion that they were gilded."
This has already been noted as a peculiarity observed hitherto almost
exclusively in the primitive bronze relics of Scotland and Ireland, and
even there occurring in greatest abundance in certain districts. Dr.
Petrie observed, at the meeting of the Academy, that all the bronze
relics found in King's County have the characteristic golden tinge referred
to, and added that the number of beautiful moulds for hatchets
and other implements of warfare found from time to time in Ireland,
prove that the ancient Irish understood the art of manufacturing
bronze instruments such as those discovered in the vessel found at
Dooros Heath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>With the desire of testing as far as possible the exact bearing of
the chemical evidence on this interesting inquiry in relation to relics
of the Scottish Bronze Period, I obtained permission from the Council
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland to submit various specimens
of bronze in the Society's collection to chemical analysis. The results
will be found to differ very remarkably from that ideal uniformity
which has been supposed to establish the conclusion of some single
common origin for the metal, if not indeed for the manufactured
weapons and implements. The experiments have been made in the
laboratory and under the directions of my brother, Dr. George Wilson,
whose acknowledged experience as an analyst is sufficient guarantee
for the accuracy of the results. In these analyses it will be seen that
the presence of lead has been detected in every instance in greatly
varying quantities, but in two of the examples exceeding the tin.</p>

<p>Five of the examples were selected from specimens in the Museum
of the Society of Antiquaries, the sixth (No. 4) is an axe in my own
possession.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> They are arranged according to the quantity of copper
present in each. No. 1 is a piece of a large bronze cauldron found
in the neighbourhood of Lauder, Berwickshire. The chief portions
of it, which still remain in the Scottish Museum, appear to have been
partially melted by excessive heat, so as to make a large hole in the
side of the vessel, and above this a thin plate of metal has been
rudely rivetted to repair the injury. No. 2 is a piece of a leaf-shaped
sword dredged out of Duddingstone Loch near Edinburgh; No. 3,
part of one of the large bronze vessels usually styled Roman camp-kettles,
found at Huntly Wood, near West Gordon, Berwickshire;
No. 4, an axe-head in my own possession, which was found in draining
a field near the village of Pentland, Mid-Lothian. This was of the
bright yellow metal so common in the earlier bronze relics of Scotland
and Ireland, and of the very rudest workmanship, having apparently
been cast in sand. It was full of air-holes, and only ground
at the edge like the most primitive axe-heads of flint. Its specific
gravity, however, it will be observed, is high, so that it must have
been hammered in order to give firmness and consistency to the imperfect
results of the crucible and mould. No. 5 is a piece of a
bronze cauldron dredged up from Duddingstone Loch, which appears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>like other large vessels of this period, to have had bronze rings attached
to it for suspension, one of which has been figured on a previous
page, from the original in the Scottish Museum. No. 6 is one
of the implements to which the name of Palstave is now given. It
was found in the parish of Denino, Fifeshire, and appears to have been
very imperfectly cast&mdash;probably in loam. Like the axe-head No. 4,
it was rough and full of air-holes, while from its peculiar form it could
not be subjected to the after-process of hammering. Its specific
gravity is accordingly unusually small. The examples, it will be seen,
present every requisite of variety, including weapons, implements,
and vessels, from Fife, Mid-Lothian, and Berwickshire, selected solely
as furnishing a comprehensive diversity in the elements of comparison.
The following are the results of the analyses and the description of
the process by which they were obtained, nearly the whole of the
experiments having been repeated several times:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These bronzes were first carefully qualitatively analyzed, and found to consist
of copper, tin, and lead. Zinc, bismuth, antimony, and silver were carefully
sought for, but could not be found. It is probable, however, that a minute trace
of the last metal, too small to admit of detection, was present, not, however, as an
artificial addition to the alloy, but as a natural accompaniment of the lead.</p>

<p>"In the quantitative analysis, a weighed portion of the bronze was digested in
nitric acid, which dissolved the copper and lead, and converted the tin into the
insoluble white peroxide. This was collected on a filter, carefully washed, dried,
and weighed, after the filter had been burned. The filtered solution containing
the copper and the lead was then evaporated to dryness along with a portion of
sulphuric acid, which converted the lead into the insoluble sulphate of that metal.
This was collected on a filter, treated like the oxide of tin, and weighed. The
solution of copper which passed through the filter was precipitated by solution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
caustic potass added in excess, and kept at the boiling point till the oxide of copper
became dark brown. It was then collected on a filter, washed with boiling water,
and weighed after the combustion of the filter.</p>

<p>"The number obtained by adding together the quantities of copper, tin, and
lead exceeds that of the quantity of bronze taken in the second and sixth analysis.
The increase is marked as excess, and is subtracted from the added numbers, so
as to reduce their sum to 100. It should probably be deducted from the copper,
which in the state of oxide is not easily deprived of the whole of the potass
employed to precipitate it, and is liable, moreover, to retain a little moisture even
when it appears quite dry. The presence, accordingly, of potass or water, or both,
increases the apparent weight of the copper. As the excess, however, amounts in
the one case only to 11/10,000th of the weight of the bronze analyzed, and in the other
to 25/10,000th of it, it does not materially influence the result, whether as deducted
from the entire alloy, or only from the copper."</p></div>

<p>To this chemical evidence I am able, through the kindness of Mr.
Bell of Dungannon, to add the following results of an analysis recently
made for him by Professor Davy of portions of two leaf-shaped bronze
swords found in Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">The iron in this alloy is probably an impurity in the other metals."</p></div>

<p>These are not the only instances in which the presence of iron has
been ascertained in Irish bronze swords. In 1774 Governor Pownall
laid before the Society of Antiquaries of London an account of some
Irish antiquities, including two bronze swords found in a bog at
Cullen, county Tipperary. In the communication he remarks,&mdash;"That
the Society might have a precise and philosophic description
of the metal, I applied to the Master of the Mint; and by his direction
Mr. Alchorn, His Majesty's Assay-master, made an accurate
assay of the metal. 'It appears,' he says, 'to be chiefly copper, interspersed
with particles of iron, and perhaps some zinc, but without
containing either gold or silver. It seems probable that the metal
was cast in its present state, and afterwards reduced to its proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
figure by filing. The iron might either have been obtained with the
copper from the ore, or added afterwards in the fusion, to give the
necessary rigidity of a weapon. But I confess myself unable to determine
anything with certainty.'"<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The analysis here appears to
have been merely qualitative; and from the indefinite reference to
the possible presence of zinc, it cannot be assumed to have been
made with great strictness. The presence of iron, however, may be
assumed as undoubted, whether it was the result of accident or design.</p>

<p>One important result which these experiments furnish is, that the
composition of the mixed metal of the Bronze Period indicates no
such uniformity as might be anticipated in manufactures derived entirely
from one source; but, on the contrary, that different examples
of it belonging to the same period exhibit all the degrees of variation
that might be expected in the work of isolated manufacturers, very
partially acquainted with the chemical properties of the standard
compound, and guided, for the most part, by the practical experience
of the result of their labours. The variations in the proportions of the
elements of the bronze are obviously such as to preclude all comparison
with any ancient type. In regard to the favourite theory of
Ph&#339;nician origin for these relics comparison is impossible, as we possess
no authentic remains of Ph&#339;nician art. An analysis of Egyptian
bronze relics, however, would furnish interesting results in regard
to the ancient metallurgic arts practised in the countries bordering
on the Mediterranean. Such arts, however, were by no means confined
to the few ancient historic races, among whom the Tyrians and
Ph&#339;nicians generally rank the foremost for skill in the working of
metals. The Turditani, a tribe occupying the province of Andalusia,
in Spain, are described by Polybius as related to the Celtæ, though
Dr. Prichard conceives it more probable that they were of Iberian
than of Celtic kindred.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> They are stated to have been the most
learned and polished people in Spain. They had books, poems, and
laws composed in verse, and boasted of a knowledge of the use of
letters for 6000 years. It is said of this people, that when the Carthaginians
made an expedition into Spain they found the Turditani
possessed of furniture and vessels of silver, and far advanced in wealth
and luxury. It is not, therefore, indispensable that Irish antiquaries
should trace their metallurgic arts to a Ph&#339;nician source, when a
country so much nearer their own, and with which many of their his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>toric
traditions indicate an early intercourse, was in possession of
similar arts at so remote a period.</p>

<p>The other point of greatest importance brought out in the above
analyses is the uniform presence of lead, though in greatly varying
quantities; amounting in the palstave to only 75/10,000; while in the
cauldron dredged from Duddingstone Loch, along with leaf-shaped
swords, perforated spear-heads, &amp;c., it exceeds the whole tin present
in the compound; amounting to 8.53 per cent. of the whole. Lead is
known to have been used by the Romans in a similar manner, possibly
from motives of economy, as in their brass coinage, in which the
antiquary has long been familiar with the presence of this metal.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> It
is also worthy of special note how greatly all the ingredients of No. 2
and No. 5 vary in proportion, though both were found together, and
undoubtedly belong to the same period. Possibly the very marked
difference in the proportion of the alloys may prove to be the result
of design, as the only other example at all resembling the Duddingstone
cauldron, No. 5, is the so-called Roman camp-kettle, No. 3, from
Berwickshire. The difference between them is considerable, but in
both the quantity of lead present is greater than of tin. No such
conclusion, however, can by any possibility be assumed in reference
to the weapons analyzed by Professor Davy. These were both swords,
similar in form, and designed for the same purpose; yet in one the
proportion of lead present greatly exceeds that of tin, while in the
other it is so small as to suggest the possibility of its presence being
accidental. A greatly more limited scale of variations would afford
evidence enough to establish the certainty of a local and independent
manufacture carried on throughout the Bronze Period, by numerous
native metallurgists possessed of just such an amount of crude practical
skill as sufficed to render the new material available for their use.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

WEAPONS AND IMPLEMENTS.</h3>


<p>The works of the Bronze Period possess an entirely new and distinct
source of interest from those which preceded them, in so far as
they exhibit not only the skill and ingenuity which is prompted by
necessity, but also the graceful varieties of form and decoration which
give evidence of the pleasurable exercise of thought and fancy. Were
we indeed to select the most perfect and highly finished productions
resulting from the knowledge of working in metals, and to place these
alongside of the best works of the Stone Period, we could hardly
avoid the conclusions, already adopted by northern archæologists, that
the works in metal belong to an entirely new and distinct race.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> A
more careful investigation, however, tends greatly to modify such conclusions
in regard to the British bronze remains. Independently of the
probable presence of Allophylian races in Britain prior to the earliest
arrival of the Celtæ&mdash;which the evidence already adduced of the very
remote period to which the existence of a human population must be
assigned seems alone sufficient to determine in the affirmative&mdash;there
can be no doubt that stone implements were in use even within the
Celtic era, and that it was not by an abrupt substitution but by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>gradual transition that they were entirely displaced by those of metal.
Reference has already been made to some striking indications of this
in the various moulds which have been discovered from time to time
in the British Isles. It is still more obvious in the numerous examples
of weapons and tools. When classified on the same simple and natural
principle which induces us to recognise the Stone Period as
prior to that of bronze, we detect the evidences of a slow and very
gradual change, and discover the link which unites the two periods
as in regular and orderly succession. In the earliest bronze axes the
form of their prototype in stone is repeated with little or no variation.
Both are equally deficient in any stop-ridge, loop, or perforation to
facilitate the securing of them to a handle; and we cannot avoid recognising
in the latter the new materials in the hands of the old worker
in stone. Another and no less suggestive class of illustrative examples
of this transition-period may be detected in the stone implements
occasionally discovered, obviously made in imitation of bronze weapons.
Mr. G. V. Dunoyer remarks in a valuable article on bronze celts,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> in
referring to a stone axe in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy,
very closely resembling the simplest form of bronze axe,&mdash;"So remarkable
is this similarity, that it is possible to suppose this class of weapon
to be the last link between the rude wedge-shaped stone celt and
that of bronze; or in it we may perceive an attempt to revert to the
old material, improving the form after that of the earliest metal implement."
It is perhaps still more legitimate to infer from it the scarcity
of the metals at this early period compelling the axe-maker, while
adopting the newer models, to retain the only material at his command.</p>

<p>Much learned and very profitless controversy has been carried on
respecting the weapons of the Bronze Period. The archæological
works of last century and of the early years of the present century,
abound with elaborate demonstrations of the correspondence of celts
and spear-heads to the Roman securis, hasta, and pilum. It may be
doubted if some of the more recent attempts to determine the exact
purpose for which each variety of bronze implement was designed
tend to much more satisfactory results. When it is considered that
the most expert and sagacious archæologist would probably be puzzled
to determine the purpose of one-half the tools of a modern carpenter
or lock-smith, it is surely assuming too much, when he stumbles on
the hoarded weapons and implements of the old Briton, who has re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>posed
underneath his monumental tumulus, with all the secrets of his
craft buried with him, for full two thousand years, to pretend to more
than a very general determination of their uses. Much mischief
indeed is done in the present stage of the science by such attempts
at "being wise above that which is written." These relics are our
written records of the old ages, and it is well that we should avoid
bringing their chroniclings into discredit by forcing on them an interpretation
they will not legitimately bear.</p>

<p>The capabilities of the new material introduced to the old workers
in stone, were pregnant with all the elements of progress, and one
of the most interesting features belonging to the Archaic Period is
the gradual development of skill, inventive ingenuity, and artistic
decorative fancy, in the series of bronze weapons and implements.
The following examples found in Scotland, while they serve to
illustrate this feature of progressive improvement, may also in some
degree help towards the establishment of a fixed nomenclature; the
want of which renders so many "Statistical" and other accounts of
important discoveries utterly useless for all practical purposes.</p>

<p>The following is an attempt to define such a system of classification
as the Scottish examples naturally admit of, assuming every additional
improvement, complexity, or ornamentation as evidence of progress,
and therefore of work of a later date.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class I.</span> consists of bronze implements made apparently in imitation
of the older ones of stone, and to which the name of Celt-axes
may therefore be very consistently applied. Of these a very primitive
specimen in the Scottish Museum is little more than an imperfectly
squared oblong piece of yellow bronze, or "Celtic brass," full of air-holes,
and evidently cast in sand. It was found in the Moss of Cree, near
Wigtown, in Galloway. The analysis of another nearly similar to this,
and found a few miles from Edinburgh, has been given in the previous
chapter. To this class also have belonged the implements cast in the
polygonal stone mould now in Belfast.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The simplicity of the mould
completely corresponds with the primitive character of the manufactures
in which it was employed; the axe-heads having been fashioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>merely by pouring the melted metal into the exposed indentation in the
stone, as the previous examples were moulded in an impression in sand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class II.</span>&mdash;In this group may with considerable propriety be placed
a peculiar class of bronze axes, of comparatively rare occurrence in
Scotland, and apparently unknown in English collections, though frequently
met with in Ireland. To these I would propose to apply the
name of Spiked Axe. The accompanying woodcut, which represents
one found along with other bronze relics at Strachur, Argyleshire, will
convey a better idea of the peculiar characteristics of the second class
of axes than any description. It might be taken for the normal type
of the medieval battle-axe, which the
mail-clad knights of the thirteenth
century bore at their saddle-bow. The
few examples met with almost invariably
exhibit the same uniformity of
thickness throughout, accompanied
with an imperfect adaptation for hafting, so as to leave us in little
doubt as to the true place of the spiked axe, first in order after its
simpler prototype.</p>

<img src="images/image253b.jpg" width="579" height="302" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Class III.</span> consists of axe-heads, not greatly dissimilar in general
form to those of the first class, but larger, and exhibiting manifest
evidence of the improvements of experienced workmen. For these
the term Axe-blades, plain or incised, appears most suitable. They
are sometimes finished with a broad flange along the sides, thereby
securing at once economy of material with lightness and strength;
and are, oftener than any other bronze relics, decorated with incised
ornamental patterns corresponding to those which occur on
the pottery of the same period. This kind of ornamentation, though
frequently executed with considerable taste, presents a striking
contrast to the graceful mouldings and perforations of the more
advanced period. It appears to have been produced in the most
simple manner, by striking the surface
with a punch, sometimes (as in
an example in the Scottish Museum,
which measures 5&frac34; inches long) with
no very marked attempt at a definite
pattern. Other, however, are characterized
by much more taste and evidences of design. The very
fine specimen figured here, from a drawing by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Bart., is like the former, of bright yellow metal. It was discovered
in the year 1818, a few inches below the surface on the Moor of Sluie,
and not far from the river Findhorn, Morayshire. Various interesting
relics have been found in this locality. In the month of March, of
the same year, a cist was uncovered on the moor, within which lay
a bronze spear-head of the primitive type, 11&frac14; inches in length, and
perforated with four holes for attaching it to a handle. The point is
considerably corroded and imperfect, and was apparently above an
inch longer when complete: beside it lay two unusually large bronze
celt-axes, about half an inch thick, and six inches long. Drawings
and a description of these were communicated to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland at the time of their discovery, by Sir Thomas
Dick Lauder, and are now preserved among the Society's MSS. Various
examples of similarly ornamented axe-blades, in the Museum of
the Royal Irish Academy, are engraved in the fourth volume of the
Archæological Journal. A very beautiful and unique specimen, found
in the county of Tipperary in 1843, and now in the collection of the
British Museum, is figured in the sixth volume of the same Journal.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
An English engraved axe-blade, of analogous type, found near Clare,
in Suffolk, along with eighteen others of various sizes, and with several
similarly ornamented, is figured in the Archæologia;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and a few other
examples of this rare class of primitive decorated weapons, from
various localities, are preserved in the British Museum. These incised
lines are supposed by many to have been designed for use as well as
ornament, and several allusions, by ancient Irish writers, to the employment
of poisoned weapons by the Celtic natives,
are referred to in confirmation of the probability
that the indented patterns were wrought on the
axe-blade to adapt it for retaining the poison with
which it was anointed preparatory to the conflict.
The rarity of the occurrence of such incised lines
militates in some degree against this theory; but
it will be seen hereafter that other devices of more
frequent adoption may have answered the same
barbarous and deadly purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class IV.</span> includes a variety of the implements
to which archæologists are now generally agreed in
applying the old Scandinavian term Paalstab, or its recently adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>English synonyme, Palstave, originally designating a weapon employed
in battering the shields of the foe. Their general characteristics partake
more of carpentering tools than of weapons of war, but in this, as in many
other instances, it is difficult to draw the distinction with any certainty,
where the objects might be of equal avail for both purposes. The palstave
consists of a wedge, more or less axe-shaped, having a groove on
each side, generally terminating in a stop-ridge, by means of which it
was united to a cleft haft, and with projecting lateral ridges, designed
still farther to secure its hold on the handle. Various improvements
on the primitive form have obviously been suggested by experience.
The woodcut represents a fine example in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries, found on the farm of Kilnotrie, parish of Crossmichael,
in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The original measures 6&frac34; inches
in length. Notwithstanding the axe-like shape of a few of the
largest of these implements, I cannot but think that the idea of the
mode of hafting them by means of a bent stick, as recently assumed,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
appears forced and improbable. In all the additions, apparently
suggested by experience, for the purpose of more effectually securing
it to the handle, no single example has been found with a bent groove,
a hollow socket or perforation, or any other of the most simple and
obvious adaptations of the metal to such a purpose. It cannot for a
moment be supposed that such an improvement was beyond the skill
or ingenuity of the metallurgist. In the example figured here, the
hole through the end appears to have been produced in the casting.
The labour of hewing the mould, or hammering the palstave into
the desired shape, with which the old worker in stone was already
familiar, would scarcely exceed that involved in the adaptation of
each wooden haft. Mr. James Yates has suggested, in an ingenious
communication to the Archæological Institute, that one of the
most important uses to which bronze celts were applied was in destroying
fortifications, entrenchments, and similar military works.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
In illustration of this the author engraves two examples from the
Nimroud Marbles, in which Assyrian soldiers are seen breaking
through a wall of brick or small stones, by means of chisels not greatly
dissimilar to our bronze celts, but fitted to a straight wooden handle.
For such operations many of the larger palstaves would be no less
suitable. The one here figured, from the original, measuring 7&frac12; inches
in length, in the valuable collection formed by Sir John Clerk at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>Penicuick House, seems peculiarly adapted for the purpose. Mr.
Yates accordingly arrives at the conclusion, that "wherever we should
now use the spade, the crow-bar, or the pick-axe, the ancients used
the palstave or the hollow celt, fastened to a straight wooden shaft;
and this was the practice, not only of the
Romans, but of the Greeks and Macedonians,
the Hebrews, Assyrians, and Carthaginians,
and of all nations to which they extended
the knowledge of their arts, or which
were sufficiently advanced in civilisation to
dwell in fortified places."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> This farther
conclusion inevitably follows, if we adopt
the ingenious theory of Mr. Yates,&mdash;that
the Britons of the Bronze Period had advanced
to a similar state of civilisation; nor
is it inconsistent with the ideas we are led
to form of their skill and progress in the
arts, that they had already reared the ingenious
earth-works which still crown the
summit of many a height both in England
and Scotland. Against such works, however, even the largest of the
bronze palstaves would prove but an inefficient implement, whether
used as a crow-bar or hatchet, and if employed as a spade, the most
of them would be of somewhat less avail than an ordinary tablespoon!
It is not always easy to discriminate unhesitatingly between the true
axe-head and the palstave. In many examples, where the general
shape is completely that of the axe-blade, both the stop-ridge and
side flanges are formed, while the narrow palstave no less frequently
wants the stop-ridge. In Sir Robert Sibbald's History of Fife and
Kinross, one of the latter class of palstaves is engraved, with a broad
double flange, evidently adapted for insertion in a cleft handle, and
which he has entitled a "brass axe found in a cairn of stones." Numerous
other examples have been discovered under similar circumstances,
leaving no room to doubt of their native origin, or of the
estimation in which they were held by their primitive owners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class V.</span> includes an improved variety of palstaves having a loop
or ear attached to them, and in many instances the sides overlapping
to a considerable extent, occasionally so much so as to meet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
form a perforation or socket for receiving the handle. In this class
the overlapping flange is often only on one side, especially where
it is turned over so as to form a socket; but in no example which
I have examined is there any adaptation of it properly suggestive
of the assumed theory of a bent handle, designed to admit of its use
as an axe. If such was its mode of hafting, it exhibits a degree of
clumsiness and inefficiency very inconsistent with the numerous
traces of inventive skill and ingenuity
observable in other relics of the same
period. The example figured here is
from one found in draining a field to
the west of Blackford Hill, near Edinburgh.
It is of the most common form, and measures 5&frac34; inches
in length.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class VI.</span> consists of the un-looped Bronze Celt, which is of comparatively
rare occurrence in Scotland, though frequently met with
in Denmark. It differs only from the more common celt in the absence
of the loop; but it is generally of a small size, and is never
found of the proportions of the largest British celts.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 571px;">
<img src="images/image257b.jpg" width="571" height="354" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Class VII.</span>&mdash;The Bronze Celt is the most common of all the relics
of this period, found of various sizes and degrees of ornament, from
the plain small celt of scarcely an inch and half, to those of five and
six inches long, fluted, and encircled with mouldings or cable-pattern
borders, and ornamented with
incised lines and embossed figures
on the blade. In Sir Robert
Sibbald's Portes, Coloniæ,
&amp;c., a Scottish example of the
engraved celt is figured, with its
blade decorated with the herring-bone
pattern, in the same
style, and perhaps with the same object as has been assumed for the
origin of the incised axe-blades of the period. Examples of engraved
celts are of much rarer occurrence than axe-blades, if indeed this
one is not unique.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The use of the loop so generally attached to
the bronze celt, as well as to one class of the palstaves, has been a
subject of scarcely less industrious speculation than the probable purpose
of the implement itself. The idea which has been repeatedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>suggested of its design as a means of securing the celt, as an
axe-head, to a bent shaft, is scarcely less unsatisfactory than in the
previous class of looped palstaves. If it was used with a thong or
cord, the fastening would be so readily exposed to injury, while at
the same time it so imperfectly accomplished the object in view, that
it appears altogether inconsistent with the general manifestation of
ingenuity and skill in the workers in metal to conceive of them adhering
to this clumsy device. The unique specimen found at Tadcaster,
with an oval bronze ring attached to the loop, and a small
ring or bead of jet upon it, so far from confirming such a theory,
seems much more consistent with its use as a means of suspension or
of securing a number together for convenient deportation.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Such is an attempt to assign a consistent classification and nomenclature
to a variety of bronze implements, hitherto most frequently
described by British archæologists under the general name of Celts,&mdash;a
matter perhaps of no very great moment, yet at least calculated to
give facility and precision to future descriptions of the discovery of
similar objects, and thereby to render such observations of greater avail
to the archæologist. They are all more or less applicable to a variety
of uses, both as mechanical tools and warlike weapons; and it is not
improbable that in entering upon any very nice attempts at discriminating
between the various purposes for which they were designed,
we shall only ingraft on the products of primitive art a subdivision
peculiar to modern civilisation. At a period much nearer our own time
the same implement sufficed the Scottish border trooper for table-knife,
couteau de chasse, and dagger; and it seems most probable
that the older Briton carried the same bronze axe with him to battle
with which he waged war against the giant oaks of his native forests.
It is a matter worthy of note, however, and calculated to excite in
us some surprise, that no bronze axe has yet been discovered, if I
mistake not, either in Britain or Ireland, with a perforation through
it,&mdash;the simplest of all means of securing it to a handle, and one
which was already familiar to the workers in stone. The following
description might indeed lead to a different conclusion, if we could
depend on the strict use of the terms employed:&mdash;"On the banks of
the Cree, in Galloway, there were several tumuli. In some of these,
when they were opened in 1754, there were found the remains of
weapons of brass, which were very much corroded. One of these was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
formed like a halbert; another was shaped like a hatchet, having in
the back part an instrument resembling a paviour's hammer. A third
was formed like a spade, but of a much smaller size, and each of these
weapons had <i>a proper aperture for a handle</i>."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Unfortunately the researches
of the Scottish archæologist are continually arrested by such
tantalizing descriptions, conveyed in vaguest terms, and with no accompanying
illustrations to help him to the true character of the
objects; leaving him to mourn the apathy of Government, which
refuses all aid to those who are striving to arrest such fleeting records
of the past, and deposit them, where alone they ought to be, in
national museums.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 594px;">
<img src="images/image259.jpg" width="594" height="145" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Lever. Pettycur.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Numerous other weapons and implements, of the same metal and
character of workmanship, have been found in the Scottish tumuli, or
in the chance hoards of bogs or alluvial deposits. Bronze gouges and
chisels are among the most common of these, though hitherto apparently
less frequently noted in Scotland than in England and Ireland.
Of rarer implements of the same era, the bronze crow-bar, or
lever, represented in the annexed woodcut, half the length of the
original, is, I think, unique. It was found in 1810, in a barrow near
Pettycur, Fifeshire, and is now in the collection of the Hon. James
Talbot. It is figured in the Archæological Journal, in illustration of
Mr. Yates's communication on the use of bronze celts in military
operations, and is described as very strong.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Its longer end, bent
perhaps accidentally, seems intended to be fixed in a stout handle of
wood, to which it could be firmly secured by the perforated wings.
Mr. Yates adds in describing it:&mdash;"The circumstance of its discovery
in a barrow is an evidence that it was used for some military purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>for barrows were not the tombs of agriculturists, gardeners, masons,
or carpenters, but of chiefs and warriors." But in making use of
such an argument it may be doubted if we are not applying the results
of modern civilisation as the standard of primitive ideas. Most
probably the greatest chief of the early Bronze Period was in many
cases also the best mason, carpenter, and military engineer, and the
most skilful worker in metals,&mdash;the literal chief, in fact, and true
Teutonic <i>king</i>, or most knowing man of his tribe. Perhaps a better
argument is to be found in the frequent decoration of the bronze celt.
There is a sense of fitness in all minds, and most surely developed in
the primitive stages of civilisation, where it acts intuitively, which
teaches man to reserve the decorative arts for objects of luxury and
pleasurable enjoyment,&mdash;then including war and the chase,&mdash;but not
to expend them on tools of handicraft and implements of toil.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The variety of lance and spear-heads is no less characteristic of the
gradual progress of the primitive worker in bronze, from the imitation
of the rude types of his obsolete stone weapons, to the production of
the large and beautiful myrtle-leaf spear-heads, finished with the
most graceful symmetry, and fully equal in character to the finest
medieval workmanship. The earliest examples are mere pieces of
hammered metal, reduced to the shape of a rude spear-head, but
without any socket for attaching them to a shaft. They manifestly
belong to the primitive transition-period, in all probability before
the northern Briton had learned to smelt or mould the newly introduced
metal. Lance and arrow-heads of the same form, or slightly
improved by being made somewhat in the shape of the barbed flint
arrow-head, are also preserved in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries;
and a curious example of the spear-head of the latter type,
measuring 10&frac12; inches in length, is engraved in the Archæological
Journal.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> It was found in 1844 by some workmen while dredging in
the bed of the Severn, about a mile and a half below Worcester, and
is made, like so many others of the simpler forms, of metal of very
bright colour and hard quality, in appearance more nearly resembling
brass than bronze. Others of the earlier forms of bronze spear-heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>are perforated with holes at the broad end, and not unfrequently retain
the rivets by which they have been attached to the shaft. A
spear-head of this class, in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
measuring 14&frac34; inches in length, has been secured by three large rivets,
two of which still remain. A drawing by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder,
in the collections of the Society, preserves the figure of another of the
same type, but with four rivets, found in a cist on the moor of Sluie,
Morayshire, in 1818. A third example, closely resembling the last,
and found on the Eildon Hills, Roxburghshire, is in the Abbotsford
collection.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> They have been cast, but obviously by workmen chiefly
familiar with the older forms of flint and stone. This class of weapons,
or Spear-blades, as they may be termed, is by no means rare.</p>

<p>The earlier implements, chiefly constructed in imitation of the
primitive stone models, were intended, for the most part, to be secured
to the shaft by means of cords or leather thongs. But the worker in
the new material soon learned its capabilities. The hollow socket was
speedily superadded, generally accompanied with a projecting middle
ridge to strengthen the weapon, and admit of its receiving more
readily an acute edge and point. To these again were added the double
loops, designed apparently for still further securing it to the shaft;
and with this addition the merely useful and essential features may
be supposed to terminate, though there is considerable variety in the
forms which spear-heads of this class display. The most common and
graceful shape might seem to be borrowed from the myrtle leaf.
Several are engraved in Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale, (<i>Plates</i> L.
and LI.,) from the collection of Sir John Clerk of Penicuick, including
some interesting varieties. One, of very rude form, and which
the author of course styles <i>Roman</i>, was found under a cairn in Galloway.
Another, curiously incised with alternate chequers of diamond
shape, is described as a <i>hasta pura</i>. A spear-head, decorated in the
same style, though with a different pattern, was found near Bilton,
Yorkshire, along with a quantity of other bronze weapons, in 1848.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
But the most singular of all the "several sorts of <i>hastæ or Roman</i>
<i>spears</i>," as Gordon delights to call them, is one figured on <i>Plate</i> LI.,
No. 6, of the Itinerarium, and which may be most fitly described as
fiddle-shaped.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Neither of these remarkable examples is now to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>found in the Penicuick collection. The woodcut represents a spear-head
with two loops, which is one of the very commonest forms of
the smaller class of Scottish bronze spears, most generally of the bright
yellow metal, apparently peculiar to Scotland and Ireland. The other
is a singular form of socketed
spear, differing from any example
I have met with elsewhere. It
was found, along with various
other bronze weapons and implements,
in a moss near Campbeltown,
Argyleshire, and is now the
property of J. W. Mackenzie, Esq.
It measures nearly seven inches
in length, by one and a half inch in greatest breadth, and is covered
with verd antique.</p>

<p>A very great variety is now discernible in the weapons of the
period. The metallurgist had at length mastered the new art, and
was rapidly advancing in taste as well as skill. His inventive powers
supplied constant novelty in the multiplication of new forms and ornamental
devices. The woodcut represents a very fine double-looped
spear-head, five and two-fifth inches long, found near the river Dean,
Angusshire, and now in the collection of Mr. Bell of Dungannon.
Javelin and spear-heads, decorated with similar indented ornaments,
have been met with both in Scotland and Ireland. The larger spear-heads
also now occur
"eyed," as it is termed, or
perforated with a variety
of ornamental openings,
frequently surrounded
with a raised border, and
otherwise decorated according
to the fancy of
the designer. Among the broken and half-melted arms dredged out
of Duddingstone Loch are numerous fragments of such Eyed Spear-heads,
and several very beautiful perfect specimens are preserved in
the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, as well as at Abbotsford, and
in other private collections. They are extremely various in form, exhibiting
such a diversity of design even in the simple patterns, as well
as of ornamental details in the more elaborate ones, as amply to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>firm
the idea suggested by so many remains of the bronze period, that
these relics were the products of no central manufactory, much less
the importation of foreign traders, but were designed and moulded
according to the taste and skill of the local artificer, most frequently
for his own use. One remarkable feature in the largest and most
elaborate of those in the Scottish Museum, represented in the annexed
engraving, abundantly confirms the system of classification
which gives it place among the later products of the Bronze Period.
It measures fully nineteen inches in length, and was found on the
lands of Denhead, in the parish of Cupar-Angus, Perthshire, about
the year 1831. The bronze, like that of many other works of the
same period, is extremely brittle, and the spear-head is broken and
imperfect. One of the fractures near the point of the blade shews that
a thin rod of iron has been inserted in the centre of the mould to give
additional strength to this unusually large weapon, and suffices to
connect it with the second transition-period, when the bronze was
giving way to the more useful and abundant metal which now nearly
supersedes all others in the useful arts. Of the simpler forms of the
eyed or perforated spear, one of the most common is pierced with two
segmental openings placed opposite to each other, or more rarely disposed
irregularly so as to convey somewhat the appearance of an S or
ogee perforation. I am indebted to Mr. Albert Way for a sketch of a
very fine example of the former type, found at Ardersier Point, Inverness-shire,
about 1750. It measures in length fourteen inches by two
and three quarters in greatest breadth. This remarkably fine specimen
was discovered in a tumulus lying by the side of a human skeleton.
A similar spear was found in Northumberland in 1847, along
with a bronze sword and other relics, the whole of which are now in
the possession of the Hon. H. Liddell. But the eyed spear-head,
which is common both in Scotland and Ireland, appears to be of rare
occurrence in England, and is, I believe, unknown among the native
antiquities of Denmark, though it has been so long the fashion with
Scottish and Irish antiquaries to assign to these relics a Scandinavian
origin. The Scottish bronze dagger of the same period is almost
invariably found to consist of a two-edged blade, tapering to a
point, and perforated with two or more holes for attaching a handle
to it by means of rivets, but without the simpler, and, as it would
seem, more obvious and secure fastening of a prolongation of the broad
end of the blade for inserting into a haft. These weapons are also
occasionally found elaborately ornamented, according to the prevailing
style of the era. They generally retain the bronze rivets, thereby
shewing that the handles had been of wood or horn, and not of
metal, as is most frequently the case with the swords and daggers of
the same era found in Denmark. The annexed figure represents a
fine example of the Scottish bronze dagger, found at Pitcaithly, Perthshire,
and now in the valuable collection of Mr. Bell of Dungannon.
It measures fully six inches in length, by two inches in greatest
breadth.</p>

<p>But the most characteristic and beautiful of all the relics of the
Bronze Period is the leaf-shaped sword, which has been frequently
found with both point and edge as sharp as when it first was used.
The examples already referred to, which were found, in 1846, on the
south side of Arthur's Seat, near Edinburgh, during the construction
of the "Queen's Drive," are equal to any that could be produced.
The largest of the two is one of the finest ever found in Scotland,
measuring twenty-six and a quarter inches in extreme length, and one
and three quarter inches at the broadest part of the blade. The form
is exceedingly simple, though graceful and well proportioned; but a
small engraving conveys a very imperfect idea of the weapon when
held in the hand.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The section of the sword shews the art with which
it is modelled, so as to secure the indispensable requisite of strength
along with a fine edge, the blade swelling in the middle, and tapering
off towards the line which runs round the entire blade within the
edge. The metal is indeed too soft, apparently, to retain a sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>edge, or to resist the contact with any hard body; but it has been
found that when this alloy has been cast into such forms, if the edge
be hammered till it begins to crack, and then ground, it acquires a
hardness, and takes an edge not greatly inferior to the ordinary kinds
of steel. Several of the bronze swords in the Scottish Museum are
broken in two, and some of them imperfect, most of such having been
found with sepulchral deposits. One of these was discovered, alongside
of a cinerary urn, in a tumulus at Memsie, Aberdeenshire. Another
was found, lying beside a human skeleton, in a cist under Carlochan
Cairn, one of the largest sepulchral cairns in Galloway, which formerly
stood on the top of a high hill on the lands of Chappelerne, parish
of Crossmichael. It was demolished in the year 1776 for the purpose
of furnishing materials to inclose a plantation. From such discoveries
we are led to infer that one of the last honours paid to the
buried warrior was to break his well-proved weapon and lay it at his
side, ere the cist was closed, or the inurned ashes deposited in the
grave, and his old companions in arms piled over it the tumulus or
memorial cairn. No more touching or eloquent tribute of honour
breaks upon us amid the curious records of ages long past. The elf-bolt
and the stone axe of the older barrow, speak only of the barbarian
anticipation of eternal warfare beyond the grave: of skull-beakers
and draughts of bloody wine, such as the untutored savage
looks forward to in his dreams of heaven. But the broken sword of
the buried chief seems to tell of a warfare accomplished, and of expected
rest. Doubtless the future which he anticipated bore faint
enough resemblance to the "life and immortality" since revealed to
men; but the broken sword speaks in unmistakable language of elevation
and progress, and of nobler ideas acquired by the old Briton,
when he no longer deemed it indispensable to bear his arms with him
to the elysium of his wild creed.</p>

<p>This graceful custom would appear to have been peculiar to Britain,
or it has escaped the attention of northern antiquaries. Mr. Worsaae
makes no mention of it in describing corresponding Scandinavian
weapons, but rather seems to imply the opposite when thus referring
to a later period,&mdash;"Skilful armourers were then in great request, and
although in other cases the Danish warrior would have thought it unbecoming
and dangerous to disturb the peace of the dead, he did not
scruple to break open a barrow or a grave, if by such means he could
obtain the renowned weapon which had been deposited beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
hero who had wielded it."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Thus we learn that from the remotest
times even to our own day, the northern warrior has esteemed his sword
the most sacred emblem of military honour. In later ages the leaders
of medieval chivalry gave names to their favoured weapons, the Trobadours
celebrated their virtues with all the extravagance of Romaunt
fable, and still the soldier's favourite sword is laid on his bier when
his comrades bear him to his rest.</p>

<p>Associations with these ancient weapons of an altogether different
nature have been suggested, chiefly in consequence of some resemblance
of the indented mouldings on the bronze swords to the ribs
and grooves frequently found on the modern Malay Creess. The design
of the latter, it is well known, is to retain poison, and it has been
supposed, not without some appearance of evidence, that such practices
were not unknown to the ancient Caledonian. This has been
already referred to as the purpose which perhaps first suggested those
rude incised lines on the earlier axe-blades, afterwards turned to
account as a means of tasteful decoration. In the ancient Irish
poem on the death of Oscar, printed in the first volume of the Royal
Irish Academy's Transactions, the spear of Cærbre is said to be poisoned,
seemingly in no figurative sense. The era of the bronze sword
is of an earlier date; but notwithstanding the graceful symbolism apparent
in some of the sepulchral rites, we have little reason for assuming
that there was anything in the degree of civilisation attained by
the Briton of that period incompatible with such savage practices.</p>

<p>Fewer primitive relics of armour or of personal covering have been
found than of weapons of war, as might naturally be expected among
a people whose partial civilisation could not so far have overcome
the natural habits acquired in the chase and the sudden foray, as to
induce them to cumber themselves with any great amount of defensive
accoutrements. Skins and furs no doubt formed their chief articles
of clothing and protection, and moreover, abundantly admitted of the
degree of ornament which the taste indicated in the decoration of their
weapons would lead them to aim at.</p>

<p>Helmets or head pieces of any kind belonging to the native Pagan
era are of extremely rare occurrence. In a tumulus at Drimnamucklach,
Argyleshire, pieces of a rudely adorned bronze helmet were
found, and are now in the possession of Mr. Campbell, the proprietor
of the estate. Gordon describes another example found in a cairn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
near the water of Cree, Galloway, but it was so cracked and brittle,
and probably also so rudely handled, that it fell to pieces on being
removed.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> There is every reason to believe that this piece of defensive
armour was not generally used among the native Britons, nor
indeed among the Scandinavian warriors of the Bronze Period. Only
one imperfect fragment of a bronze helmet exists in the ample collections
of the Christiansborg Palace at Copenhagen. Diodorus refers to
the brazen helmet of the Gauls, but both Herodian and Xiphiline
speak of the Britons as destitute of this defensive head-piece. Their
matted locks, which they decorated with the large and massive hair-pins
of gold, silver, or bronze, so frequently found with other relics,
sufficed them alike for protection and ornament. This custom was
probably common to all the northern races. But the indispensable
defensive armour of the old British warrior was his shield, frequently
made entirely of bronze or of wood covered with metal, and sometimes
adorned with plates of silver and even gold.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Bronze Buckler, Ayrshire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ancient bronze shield is of common occurrence both in Britain
and Ireland, and forms one of the most ingenious specimens of primitive
metallurgic art. In 1780 a singular group of five or six bronze
bucklers was discovered in a peat moss, six or seven feet below the
surface, on the farm of Luggtonrigge, near Giffin Castle, Ayrshire.
The shields were regularly disposed in a circle, and one of them, which
passed into the possession of Dr. Ferris, was subsequently presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
by him to the Society of Antiquaries of London. It has a semi-globular
umbo, surrounded by twenty-nine concentric rows of small
studs, with intervening ribs, and measures 26&frac34; inches in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Like all the primitive British bucklers, it will be seen that it was
designed to be held in the hand, the raised umbo in the centre
being hollow to receive and protect the hand where it grasped the
cross bar, seen on the under side in the annexed engraving. The
central umbo is surrounded with a series of rings of bronze set with
small studs, and the two pins seen on the inner side have perhaps
secured a strap for suspending it to the neck of the wearer when not
in use. In 1837 two remarkably fine bronze shields of this description
were exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland by Mr.
George Wauchope of Niddry, which were found near Yetholm, about
eight miles from Kelso, at a depth of four feet, by a labourer engaged
in digging a drain. Sir Robert Sibbald describes among Scottish
antiquities obtained on the sites of ancient camps, "pieces of harness
of brass: some for the arms and some for the legs. Shields also are
found; some oblong and oval, and some orbicular. Some of these
are of brass and some of wood full of brass nails."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> It is probable
that many of the shields of the same period were made chiefly of wood
and leather, with the central umbo of bronze; the latter being occasionally
discovered alone in barrows. In the circular Highland target,
which is still to be met with among collected relics of the clans, we
find a curious example of the imitation of the earlier model of the
Bronze Period. Though the Roman example of wearing the shield on
the arm has been followed by the Scottish mountaineer, rendering the
hollow umbo no longer of use, yet it appears to the last in the boss of
his target, furnishing another striking proof of the unreasoning tenacity
with which the Celtic races are found to cling to ancient customs.</p>

<p>Among the specimens of defensive armour preserved in the Museum
of the Scottish Antiquaries, are two pieces of thin copper, decorated
with indented ornaments, which were presented to the Society by
Sir George Mackenzie of Coull, Bart., in 1828. They are described
by the donor as pieces of copper, supposed to be plate armour, or the
covering of a shield, found in a cairn, under an oak tree at Craigdarroch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>Ross-shire. Various other portions were found along with these,
and their appearance seems fully to justify the supposition of the donor.
In the autumn of 1849 a remarkable discovery of bronze arms and
other antiquities was made in the Isle of Skye. They included swords,
spear-heads, celts, and a bronze pin with a hollow cup-shaped head
similar to one figured in the Archæological Journal, a relic of one of
the Irish Crannoges, or island strengths.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> A gold armilla and other ornaments
of the same precious metal are also said to have been obtained
along with these ancient remains, and beside them lay the fragments
of an oaken chest in which the whole appeared to have been deposited.
The most of these valuable relics were secured by Lord Macdonald,
but one curious and probably unique implement fell into private hands,
and has since been deposited in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.
In general appearance it resembles a bent spear-head; but
it has a raised central ridge on the
inside, while it is nearly plain and
smooth on the outer side. It has a
hollow socket, and is perforated with
holes for securing it to a handle by
means of a pin. The most probable
use for which it has been designed
would seem to be for scraping out the
interior of canoes and other large vessels made from the trunk of the
oak. But we necessarily reason from very imperfect data when we
ascribe a specific purpose to the implements of a period the arts and
habits of which must have differed so essentially from our own.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 529px;">
<img src="images/image269.jpg" width="529" height="420" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another class of bronze implements not uncommon in Ireland, and
occasionally mentioned among those discovered in Scotland, includes
what are generally described as reaping or pruning-hooks. One of these,
which was found at a depth of six feet in a bog in the neighbourhood
of Ballygawley, county of Tyrone, now preserved in the British
Museum, is figured in the Archæological Journal.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Another engraved
in General Vallancey's Collectanea,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> is described as "a small securis,
called by the Irish a <i>searr</i>, to cut herbs, acorns, mistletoe, &amp;c." About
the year 1790, a similar instrument was discovered at Ledberg, in
the county of Sutherland, by some labourers cutting peats, and was
pronounced by the Earl of Bristol, then Bishop of Derry, to whom it
was presented, to be a Druidical pruning-hook, similar to several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>found in England.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Perhaps among the same relics of primitive
agricultural skill ought also to be reckoned a curious weapon or implement
of bronze, occasionally found in Scotland, two examples of
which are figured here. One of them is from the original in the
Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries. It
was found among
the remains of many
large oak trees, on
the farm of Rottenmoss
or Moss-side, in
the vicinity of Crossraguel
Abbey, Argyleshire,
and is not inaptly described by its donor as nearly resembling
one of the common forms of the Malay Creess. It measures
fourteen inches in length. The other and more finished implement
of the same kind is in the collection formed by the distinguished
Scottish antiquary, Sir John Clerk, at Penicuick House. It is furnished
with a hollow shaft or socket for the handle. The same interesting
and valuable collection includes other specimens of this
primitive implement, constructed like that in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries, with only a metal spike for insertion into the
haft. Some examples of this relic of old agricultural skill are of
extremely small dimensions, measuring only from six to eight inches
in the length of the blade, and should perhaps more correctly be described
as pruning-hooks or knives. But in this, as in so many other
attempts to assign a use to obsolete implements, the most probable
suggestions of their original purpose are at best but guesses after the
truth.</p>

believe that the Bronze Period developed
itself among the aborigines gradually or
step by step out of the Stone Period. On
the contrary, instead of the simple and uniform
implements and ornaments of stone,
bone, and amber, we meet suddenly with a
number and variety of splendid weapons,
implements, and jewels of bronze, and sometimes
indeed with jewels of gold. The transition
is so abrupt that from the antiquities
we are enabled to conclude that the Bronze
Period must have commenced with the irruption
of a new race of people, possessing a
higher degree of cultivation than the early
inhabitants."</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

DOMESTIC AND SEPULCHRAL VESSELS.</h3>


<p>Along with the weapons and implements of this period there have
also been found at various times drinking cups, culinary vessels, horns,
and other similar relics calculated to throw some additional light on
the manners and domestic habits of the people by whom they were
wrought and used. There have not indeed been discovered, or at
least preserved, among the sepulchral deposits or the chance disclosures
of the Scottish bogs and alluvial strata, anything to be compared
with the celebrated Danish golden horns, or the beautiful
silver cups of a later era, such as that taken from the grave of Queen
Thyre Danebod, at Jellinge in Denmark. There are not wanting,
however, undefined but not the less certain traces of the like costly
memorials of primitive native art, discovered only to be destroyed.
On the lands of Garthland, Wigtownshire, two vessels made of gold,
and described as lachrymatories, were discovered in 1783.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> At the
village of Lower Largo, Fifeshire, a treasure was found in a sepulchral
deposit, sufficient it is believed to enrich the original finder. The
only relics which escaped destruction are two armillæ of pure gold,
and remarkable for their elegance and skilful workmanship.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In
1839 a tenant engaged in levelling and improving a field on the estate
of Craigengelt, near Stirling, opened a large circular cairn, which
bore the popular name of "The Ghost's Knowe." It measured
exactly 300 feet in circumference, and nearly fifty feet in height, and
around its base twelve large stones were disposed at regular intervals.
Underneath this cairn a large cromlech or stone chamber was found,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>the upright stones of which were about five feet high, and within it
lay a skeleton, imbedded in matter which emitted a strong resinous
odour, but the bones rapidly crumbled to dust on exposure to the air.
The gentleman on whose estate this remarkable cairn stood,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> and to
whom I am chiefly indebted for its description, had given strict orders
to send for him if a cist or coffin was discovered; but while operations
were delayed in expectation of his arrival, one of the labourers
plundered the hoard and fled. Many valuable articles are reported to
have been found; among which was a golden horn or cup, weighing
fourteen ounces, and ornamented with chased or embossed figures.
This interesting relic was purchased from one of the labourers by a
gentleman in Stirling, and is believed to be still in existence, though
I have failed, after repeated applications, in obtaining access to it.
The exact nature or value of the whole contents of this cairn is not
likely ever to be ascertained. The only articles secured by the proprietor,
and now in his possession, are a highly polished stone axe or
hammer, eight inches long, rounded at one end, and tapering at the
other; a knife or dagger of the same material, eighteen inches long,
which was broken by one of the stones falling on it when opening the
cist; and a small gold finger ring, chased and apparently originally
jewelled, though the settings have fallen out. Several other large
cairns still remain unexplored at Craigengelt, some of them of much
larger dimensions than the one which yielded such interesting results.
English tumuli and primitive deposits have occasionally furnished
still more valuable gold relics; such as the native gold corslet found
in Wales, now in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Golden vessels have also
been found under similar circumstances, as in a cairn near the Cheese
Wring, in Linkenhorne parish, Cornwall, which was accidentally broken
into in 1818, and a gold cup found lying beside the sepulchral remains.
It was opened by some miners, who had selected the mound
as an appropriate site on which to erect an engine-house. Within the
cairn was a large cromlech, and underneath this lay a flat stone measuring
nine feet long by about four broad, which covered the sepulchral
deposit. In this chamber a thin slab, placed in a shelving direction
against one of the sides, protected its valuable contents from
injury. The remains of a skeleton lay extended on the floor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>cist, and about the position of the breast stood an earthen vessel,
within which was placed the gold cup. It is bell-shaped and rounded
below, like the Danish gold cups found under similar circumstances
and engraved in the "Guide to Northern Archæology." The earthen
vessel was unfortunately broken by the fall of the stone that covered
it, but its fragments exhibited the usual incised ornamentation of the
early British pottery. A bronze spear was likewise found with these
remarkable relics. The gold cup was claimed for the Crown as Lord
of the Duchy of Cornwall, and it is believed to be still at Windsor
Castle.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> It would find a more appropriate place in the long desiderated
British department of the British Museum.</p>

<p>As we cannot doubt but that these buried records of primitive native
history have as yet been only very partially disclosed, so also we may
hope that the rarer and more curious relics of the precious metals
are also unexhausted, and that golden horns and silver beakers,
adorned with the well-defined decorations of the Archaic era of
native art, may still lie safely garnered in the same store-house
and registry from whence so many historic records have been drawn
forth, reserved for better times, when their discovery shall no longer
involve their destruction. It will be seen from the number and variety
of personal ornaments of the same precious metals described in future
chapters, that such ideas are not mere chimerical dreams. Whencesoever
the metal was derived, gold appears to have been used in
Scotland to a very great extent, from the earliest period of the introduction
of the metals, and to have been frequently deposited in the
sepulchres of the most honoured dead, with no fear that sacrilegious
hands would disturb the sacred deposit.</p>

<p>Vessels of bronze are by no means so rare as those of the precious
metals. They are not indeed often found in the tumuli, and
have obviously been held in less esteem than the weapons and personal
ornaments of the same metal. But among the interesting disclosures
brought to light by the draining of bogs and lakes, and the
ordinary processes of agriculture, no class of relics have been more
frequently discovered than the various culinary and domestic utensils
of bronze, generally known by the names of Roman tripods and camp-kettles.
Some of these do undoubtedly belong to the Anglo-Roman
era; but the whole have been much too indiscriminately assigned to
the legionary invaders and colonists, whose occupation of Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
was equally brief and partial, and whose relics must therefore form a
very small proportion even of those of the later period to which they
belong.</p>

<p>In the "Account of the Dominion of Farney," by Evelyn Philip
Shirley, Esq., an engraving is given of a singular cauldron, made with
considerable taste and skill, of plates of hammered bronze, rivetted
together with pins of the same metal, the heads of which are conical
in form, and being regularly disposed, serve to decorate as well as to
secure the vessel. Two bronze rings are fastened to the inside of the
rim by ornamental staples, and with these it was obviously designed
to be suspended over the fire. This remarkable relic, which measures
sixty inches in widest circumference, was discovered in the year 1834,
at a depth of twelve feet below the surface of a bog, in the barony of
Farney, Ulster. Bronze rings and staples, similar to those attached
to this ancient cauldron, have been frequently found in Scotland.
One of them has been already referred to, which was dredged out of
Duddingstone Loch, near Edinburgh, along with a large quantity of
bronze arms. Several others are preserved in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries, two of which (measuring each 4&frac34; inches in
diameter) were found along with the bronze cauldron here represented.
Its dimensions are twenty-five inches in greatest diameter, and sixteen
inches in height. No question can exist of its native workmanship.
The rings and staples are neatly designed, but rudely and imperfectly
cast and finished, and are decorated exactly as those of the
Farney cauldron. The circles embossed on the side of the vessel are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in like manner such as have been frequently noted on objects of the
Bronze Period, both in Britain and on the Continent. Nevertheless,
in accordance with the classical system of designation which is even
yet only partially exploded, this remarkable native relic figures in the
printed list of donations in the Archæologia Scotica as a Roman
camp-kettle. It was dug up in the year 1786, from the bottom of the
peat-moss of Kincardine, some miles west from Stirling, where it was
discovered lying upon a stratum of clay beneath the moss, which
generally ranges from seven to twelve feet deep. Evidence has
already been referred to which leads to the conclusion that the moss
of Kincardine was in the same state at the period of Agricola's invasion
as it continued to be till nearly the close of the eighteenth century.
A curious allusion to this locality, in Blind Harry's Life of Sir
William Wallace, which refers to the moss as incapable of passage on
horseback, leaves us in no doubt as to its condition in the fourteenth
century. After Wallace and his adherents had surprised an English
garrison in the Peel of Gargunnoch,</p>

</div></div>

<p>Another large shallow vessel of hammered copper, made entirely of
one piece, is in the same collection with the above. It bears considerable
resemblance to one discovered at Huckeridge Hill, near Sawston,
Cambridgeshire, in 1816, and figured with other "Celtic remains" in
the Archæologia, (vol. xviii. <i>Pl.</i> XXIV.,) but wants the embossed ornaments
which encircle the rim of the latter. It measures fully eighteen
inches in diameter by six inches deep, and was found at a depth of
eighteen feet below the present level of the Cowgate, Edinburgh.
Notwithstanding the difficulty of accounting for so great an accumulation
of soil, there is perhaps greater probability in assigning this as
part of the <i>curta supellex</i> of some wealthy citizen of the Scottish
capital, at a period belonging to the latest epoch of the archæologist.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
But no doubt can be entertained as to the remote era of another such
relic already referred to,&mdash;the large bronze cauldron dug up about
eighteen years since in a bog in King's County, and now in the collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>of the Earl of Rosse. Among the smaller examples of Scottish bronze
vessels, one is specially deserving of notice, which was found by a
labourer while cutting turf in Lochar Moss, Dumfriesshire, about two
miles north from Cumlongan Castle, accompanied by relics of pure
native character. It is a small bowl of graceful form, measuring six
and a half inches in diameter and three in depth, formed of thin bronze
plate of the bright colour common to many of our primitive relics,
and very skilfully wrought. Within it lay one of the curious ornamental
collars more particularly described in a later page,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> to which
the name of Beaded Torc is now assigned. Lochar Moss, where these
interesting antiquities were discovered, has proved a fertile field for
archæological treasures of many different eras,&mdash;primitive canoes,
native stone and bronze relics, products of Roman civilisation and
medieval art; while within it lie embedded the trunks of gigantic
oaks and other natives of the forest, which once occupied the area of
this ancient and extensive morass.</p>

<p>Of the more usual forms of tripods, kettles, and cauldrons of bronze,
which are commonly assigned to the Romans, I must speak with more
hesitation, though both the circumstances under which these have
been found, and the style of some of their decorations, are sufficient
to shew that they have been much too summarily classed among
foreign productions. So long as bronze continued to be the rare and
precious metal which we find good evidence for concluding it to have
been during a transition-period of considerable duration, we may be
well assured that neither domestic utensils, nor such implements of
common use as the older material could supply, would be manufactured
of it. We have abundant proof, however, that the supply of
the metals kept pace with the increasing demands of progressive
civilisation; and as this gradually displaced the old barbarian habits
of the Caledonian savage by more refined tastes, the gratification of
the palate would be aimed at along with the simpler desire for the
mere supply of animal wants. Hence we may trace in the bronze
cauldron and the tripod evidences of native civilisation, though
doubtless of a late period, and not improbably, in many cases, coeval
with the era of Roman invasion. Bronze vessels, of the description
to which we refer, have been frequently found not only in the north
of Scotland and in Ireland, but in Denmark and Sweden, where no
Roman legions ever established a footing; though we must, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
course, bear in remembrance that Roman culinary implements, like
Roman coins, might reach many regions which their makers never
visited. But classical writers make special reference to the abundance
of such vessels among the Gauls, and even ascribe to the Bituriges
the invention of the art of tinning them.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> In the <i>Samlingar f&ouml;r</i>
<i>Nordens Forn&auml;lskare</i>, (<i>Plate</i> XXII. vol. ii.,) an ancient Swedish bronze
vessel is represented, in no way differing from the common form of
what is here invariably designated a Roman camp-kettle, but surrounded
with an ornamental belt, decorated with what appear in the
engraving somewhat like Runic characters. A still more remarkable
medieval example of the bronze kettle is engraved in the Archæologia<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
under the name of an ancient hunting pot. It is of the same common
form, but is ornamented in relief with the symbols of the Evangelists,
and with various devices, chiefly relating to the chase, and is
encircled with the following inscriptions:&mdash;<span class="antiqua">Vilelmus Angetel me fecit fieri</span>.
And underneath, in smaller characters, this couplet,&mdash;</p>

<p>Many bronze vessels discovered in Scotland have been found on the
draining or cutting of mosses, into which they may be supposed to
have been thrown on the sudden flight either of the native Briton or
the Roman invader, according as we incline to assign them to the
one or the other. I am not aware, however, of such having yet
been met with, either at any of the great Scoto-Roman coloniæ,
such as Inveresk or Cramond, or on the sites of the legionary
stations on the wall of Antoninus, though the remarkable discovery
of Roman relics at Auchindavy, in 1771, including five altars and a
statue, all huddled together in one pit, furnishes no doubtful evidence
of the precipitancy with which the legionary cohorts were compelled
to abandon the Caledonian wall.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> An interesting discovery of such
bronze vessels was made a few years since in the grounds immediately
adjoining the cloisters of Melrose Abbey, and distant only
a few miles from the Roman station, near Eildon. Similar objects
have in like manner been frequently discovered in Galloway, Nithsdale,
and in the district surrounding Birrenswork Hill, the celebrated
<i>Blatum Bulgium</i>, where, among other curious relics of the Roman
invaders, was found the winged figure of the goddess Brigantia, a
supposed native deity adopted by the complaisant conquerors into
the orthodox Pantheon of the Roman world. All these districts,
however, abound still more with traces of native occupation, such as
the most classical of modern Oldbucks would hesitate to ascribe to
a Roman origin. While, however, I feel satisfied that many of these
bronze vessels are the products of native art, others are unquestionably
Roman, and many more have probably been made after Roman
models, so that the attempt to discriminate between them is attended
with difficulty. The mere rudeness of workmanship of many of them
is not in itself a conclusive argument against their Roman manufacture,
since we are hardly justified in looking for all the refinements
of classic art in the furniture of the camp kitchen. It may fairly,
however, suggest doubts, which receive stronger confirmation when
we find it associated with forms peculiar to the northern designer:
as in the snake-head with which the spout is frequently terminated.
Such is the case with one of the so-called Roman tripods in the
Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, which was found in its present
imperfect state at a depth of five feet below the surface, in a moss
near Closeburn Hall, Dumfriesshire.
It is of a form of very
frequent occurrence, and the decoration
of the spout, though
also not uncommon, is such as
an unprejudiced critic would be
much more inclined to ascribe to
British or Scandinavian than
Roman art. It is figured here
along with another of rarer form
dug up in the neighbourhood of
Dundee, and now preserved at
Dalmahoy House.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> The superstitious veneration which ignorance
attaches more or less readily to whatever is derived from a remote or
unknown origin, has not failed to include these ancient utensils
among the objects of its devotion or fear. In Ireland, more especially,
this feeling is still powerful in its influence on the peasantry,
and not unfrequently throws additional obstacles in the way of anti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>quarian
research. But in Scotland it was also equally powerful at
no very remote date, nor was its influence limited to the unlettered
peasant. In the great hall of Tullyallan Castle, near Kincardine,
there formerly hung suspended from one of the bosses of its richly
sculptured roof an ancient bronze kettle of the most usual form, which
bore the name of <i>The Lady's Purse</i>. It was traditionally reputed to
be filled with gold; and the old family legend bore, that so long as it
hung there the Castle would stand and the Tullyallan family would
flourish. Whether the Blackadders of Tullyallan ever had recourse
to the treasures of the lady's purse in their hour of need can no
longer be known, for the castle roof has fallen, and the old race who
owned it is extinct. The ancient cauldron, however, on the safety of
which the fate of the owners was believed to hang, is preserved. It
was dug out of the ruins by a neighbouring tenant, and is still
regarded with the veneration due to the fatal memorial of an extinct
race. It measures 8&frac14; inches in diameter by 5&#x215B; inches in height as
it stands, and is simply what would be called by antiquaries a Roman
camp-kettle, and by old Scottish dames a brass kail-pot! This medieval
tradition suffices at least to show that the object of its superstitious
veneration pertained to an older era than that of the Baron's Hall.</p>

<p>A remarkable discovery of a number of bronze vessels of the class
alluded to here, was made in the autumn of 1848, by some labourers
engaged in trenching a piece of mossy ground, situated under a
peculiar ridge of trap rock about a mile and a half due south of
North-Berwick Law, on the Balgone estate, the property of Sir George
Grant Suttie, Bart. The whole ground, extending to above twenty
acres, was formerly a morass. It has been partially drained of late
years, in consequence of which the mean level has sunk three to
four feet. In the centre of this morass the relics were found, consisting
of a large bronze pot or cauldron, several tripods, goblets, and
various fragments of thin plates of bronze, all much corroded. One
of the bronze goblets lay within the large cauldron, and the whole
were found close together, at a depth of about three feet from the
surface, apparently just as they had been thrown into the morass,
probably not less than seventeen centuries ago.</p>

<p>Another class of works of ancient art and constructive skill, which
come under the notice of the archæologist, admit of much more decided
and unhesitating assignment to the native manufacturer. These
are the specimens of pottery of such frequent occurrence in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
tumuli and cists, and which present, in every respect, so striking a
contrast to the fictile manufactures of the Roman colonists. It is
not from any doubt of the use of the sepulchral urn, and of the rites
of cremation, during the primitive period, that all notice of native
fictile ware has been reserved till now, though both furnish undoubted
evidence of some progress attained by the primitive Briton.
It is altogether impossible, however, with the very limited amount of
accurately observed facts with which the Scottish archæologist has to
deal, to pretend to classify into distinct periods the pottery found in
the ancient tumuli and cairns. Many of these fictilia are so devoid
of art as to furnish no other sign of advancement in their constructors
from the most primitive state of barbarism, than such as is
indicated by the piety which provided a funeral pyre for their dead,
and even so rude a vase wherein their ashes might be inurned.</p>

<p>One obvious distinction is at once apparent between the unsymmetrical
hand-made urn and that which has been turned and fashioned
into regular shape. Yet even this very marked subdivision will not
suffice for chronological arrangement; for the very rudest and most
unsymmetrical of all the hand-made urns in the Scottish Museum,
devoid of grace, and destitute of the very slightest attempt at ornament,
was found to cover a pair of gold armillæ somewhat roughly
finished with the hammer, and three smaller rings of the same metal,
two of which are neatly ornamented with parallel grooves.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> It seems,
indeed, as if some pious hand may have hastily fashioned the clay
into shape while the flames of the funeral pile were preparing the
ashes it was to hold.</p>

<p>It is obvious even from this single instance, that any assignment
of special examples or classes of native fictilia to the primeval period
can only be done on the distinct ground of their being found accompanied
solely with the relics of flint and stone. Still, setting aside
the idea of a precise chronological arrangement, somewhat may be
done as an approximation towards a system of classification. The early
British pottery, though at best sufficiently rude, exhibits considerable
variety both in form and workmanship, from the coarsest specimens
of unshapely sun-dried clay to the graceful and elaborately decorated
vases evidently made by workmen who had acquired a knowledge of
the potter's wheel. Though the whole of these are found with sepulchral
deposits, it is rarely difficult to discriminate between domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
vessels and cinerary urns, independently of the contents of the latter.
The presence of the cup and bowl alongside the weapons and implements
deposited with the ashes of the deceased warrior, is readily
accounted for. The difficulty which the uncultivated mind experiences
in realizing any adequate conception of death, or of a future
state, apart from the daily necessities and cravings of the body, has
led in many different stages of social progress to the custom of depositing
food and drink, unguents, perfumes, and similar necessaries
or luxuries of life beside the body of the loved dead, or even along
with the cinerary urn. The archæologist has accordingly been long
familiar with the fact, that some at least of the fictile vessels found
in the tumuli are not sepulchral, and the names of "drinking cups"
or "incense cups" have been given to one class of small vases frequently
deposited in cists and barrows.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious subdivision which the early British fictile
ware admits of, is into hand-made and wheel-made pottery.
Notwithstanding the remarkable example above referred to of the
discovery of the former along with gold relics, it is most probable
that the hand-made pottery will be generally found to belong to the
earliest period. The inverse argument is at any rate indisputable,
which assigns the wheel-made pottery to the period of partially developed
art and tutored skill. Even in the case of the rude example
found in Banffshire, the gold armillæ are roughly wrought with the
hammer, and may have been fashioned from the native gold by a
workman who knew of its ductility, but had yet to learn the use of
the furnace, the crucible, and the mould. We know from the most
ancient records both of sacred and profane history, that the potter's
wheel is among the earliest inventions of primitive art. It is referred
to by the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah as the most familiar illustration
of creative power; and the hieroglyphics and symbolic paintings
still visible on the temples of Egypt, prove that the simile is older by
many generations than that day when the Hebrew prophet "went
down to the potter's house, and behold he wrought a work on the
wheels." On the wall of a chamber in the ruined temple of Philæ,
which, however, belongs to the era of the Ptolemies, one of the most
striking adaptations of the prophetic symbol has been noted. Kneph,
the ram-headed god, is represented seated at a potter's wheel, which
he turns with his foot, while he fashions the mass of clay on it with
his hands. The hieroglyphic inscription which accompanies it is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
rendered:&mdash;"Knum, the Creator, moulds on his wheel the Divine
members of Osiris, (the father of men,) in the house of life." It is
an old Egyptian version of the simple but sublime language of Isaiah:
"O Lord! thou art our Father, we are the clay, and thou our potter."
The contents of the earliest Egyptian tombs furnish abundant
evidence of the perfection to which the potter's art had been carried;
and the recent discoveries at Nimroud and along the banks of the
Tigris disclose no less satisfactory proofs of equal skill among the
ancient dwellers in the great central plains of Asia, from whence the
nomade colonists of Britain have been traced. The ignorance, therefore,
of the simple contrivance of the potter's wheel furnishes more
conclusive proof of a rude and barbarous state of society even than
the stone weapons and implements of the same period. In the one
instance we see the intelligent barbarian ingeniously turning to the
best account his very limited materials, and effectively supplying the
want of metals apparently from the most inadequate resources. In
the other we find him fashioning the plastic clay with far less skill
or symmetry than the thrush or the common barn-swallow displays in
the construction of its nest. It may therefore be assumed as a general
rule, that the unsymmetrical hand-made urn belongs to a very early
period, and must in most cases be considered the work of an era prior
to the introduction of the wheel, or the practice of the decorative
arts so abundantly employed in the adornment of later specimens of
the same ware.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Urns found at Banchory.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rudimentary form of the cinerary urn is the common flower-pot
shape, which the potter still finds the easiest and simplest into which
the plastic clay can be fashioned. The later fictile ware, however,
which is found deposited in the sepulchres, apparently for the purpose
of holding food or preserving other tributes of affection or
reverence, is characterized by considerable variety both in shape and
decoration. Vases of a peculiar form, and apparently not sepulchral
but domestic&mdash;in so far as they lay beside unburnt bones, and contained
no incinerated remains&mdash;were discovered in several stone cists
dug up in the years 1833 and 1834, in the parish of Whitsome, Berwickshire.
The cists measured internally four and a half feet in length,
and lay north and south. "Each chest had also its urn of unglazed
earthenware, and of a triangular shape, the original contents of which
had been converted into a quantity of black dust."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> I have in vain
attempted to ascertain if any of these singular examples of primitive
fictile ware are still in existence. The two urns here represented
were found under circumstances which seem in like manner to indicate
their original use as domestic rather than sepulchral vessels,
though they differ little from shapes of frequent occurrence in cinerary
urns. They were found in the year 1817 by a party of men employed
in levelling a piece of ground on a farm at Banchory, Aberdeenshire.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
In the progress of their work their tools struck on a
stone, which proved to be the cover of a cist of unusually large
dimensions, lying nearly due NE. and SW. It was composed of six
stones, so arranged that the skeleton which lay within at full length
was bent at the pelvis to fit the angular construction of the cist. It
measured internally, in a straight line, six feet, by two and a quarter feet
at the north end, where the head lay, and only one foot ten inches at
the lower end. The whole was composed of rough undressed mica-slate
of from three to five inches thick. Within this the skeleton was disposed
in the singular position above described, with the vases on its right
side, one opposite the knee and the other at the thigh-joint. Nothing
was found in them but some sand which had fallen in on opening the
cist. The largest measured six and a half inches, and the other five
inches in height. They are described as "composed of the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>stones of the country pounded,&mdash;granite, mica-slate, apparently some
moss-earth, and a little clay on the outside. They are wonderfully
accurately made, and the patterns meet so well that one would think
they had been done in a lathe or stamped. They are perfectly circular,
and seem to have been only baked in the sun." Several cists
have been discovered in the same neighbourhood, but no other example
is known to have corresponded to this either in disposition or
contents. The whole skeleton crumbled into dust after being exposed
for a short time to the air; but it would appear to have exhibited
the wonted characteristic of a remarkably small head in proportion
to the body. The discoverer remarks: "The teeth are perfectly
fresh; and from the appearance of the jaws the skeleton must
be that of a full-grown person, though of small stature."</p>

<p>A still more remarkable example of pottery somewhat similarly
disposed, was discovered more recently on the demolition of the
old town steeple of Montrose. This venerable belfry tower, which
was ascribed to the twelfth century, occupied the highest ground
in the centre of the ancient burgh. After serving for centuries
as clock-tower, belfry, and prison, the fabric at length became so
ruinous that it was taken down in 1833. In digging the foundations
for the new steeple, which occupies its site, the workmen excavated
the ground about nine feet below the surface, and fully three feet
below the base of the old tower. Remains of several bodies were
found in the new ground: one of which lay with the head towards
the west, and had a small pile driven through the skull. In another
part, directly underneath the foundations of the old tower, was a skeleton
disposed at full length in a rude stone cist, and with four urns
beside it: two at the head and two at the feet. The skeleton measured
six feet in length, and the skull, which has been already referred
to, is now in the Edinburgh Phrenological Museum.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Only two
of the urns were preserved; one of which is now in the Montrose
Museum, and the other in the collection of the Scottish Antiquaries.
The latter is a neat vessel of common form, and decorated with the
usual style of incised chevron ornaments. There is something peculiarly
interesting in the recovery of these memorials of long forgotten
generations, over which later builders had reared the massive tower
unconscious of their presence. The strong old Gothic masonry, after
withstanding the storms of some seven centuries, has decayed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>been swept away, and from beneath its foundations we recover the
fragile yet more enduring memorials of primitive skill pertaining to a
far older era, when the infant nation was just struggling into intelligent
youth.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable classes of domestic pottery found in
the tumuli, are those evidently designed for suspension, and occasionally
provided with a cover or lid made of the same material. Some
of them are made round on the bottom, so as to be unfitted for setting
on the ground, and it seems no improbable inference that in these we
possess examples of the earliest artificial cooking vessels manufactured
by native skill. They are familiar to continental as well as to British
archæologists, and are figured in several works on Scandinavian antiquities.
The example engraved here, from the original in the Scottish
Museum, measures 4&frac12; inches in
height, and about 6&frac12; inches in extreme
diameter. It was found in one of a
group of cists, under a large cairn, situated
at a place called Sheal Loch, in the
parish of Borthwick, near Edinburgh,
and is minutely described by Dr. Jamieson
in the Archæologia Scotica.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Five
perforated projections are disposed at
nearly equal distances around it, and the interior of the vessel bears
evident marks of fire. Nothing but clay was found either in it or the
inclosing cist, and no urns were discovered in any of the adjoining
graves. It appears to be made of fine baked clay, and is of a much
harder and more durable consistency than the majority of specimens
of Celtic pottery. Urns perforated for suspension, though by no
means common, are occasionally found in the British tumuli. The
fragments of another, found in Fifeshire, with perforated ears, are
preserved in the same collection with the above; and a third example,
found in a cairn at Crakraig, Sutherlandshire, in 1818, and
engraved in the Archæologia,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> appears to have been of the same
class. Reference has already been made to a small cup discovered
during the construction of the "Queen's Drive" round Arthur Seat
in 1846, and, as is believed, alongside of the cinerary urn, alluded
to in a former chapter, which was broken in pieces by the workmen.
The little cup is formed with great regularity, and orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>mented
with a uniform pattern, the lines of which seem as if they
had been impressed on the soft clay with a fine twisted cord. It
measures 1&frac34; inches in height, 3&frac14; inches in extreme diameter, and
fully half an inch in thickness.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Another cup, in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries, of still more regular proportions, and a higher
style of ornamentation, was dug out of the foundation of an ancient
ruin in the island of Ronaldshay, Orkney, and presented to the Society
in 1831. Like the larger urns referred to above, it is perforated for
suspension. Similar cups are of comparatively frequent occurrence;
sometimes devoid of ornament, but generally symmetrical, and finished
with a degree of art and skill indicative of their construction, and of
the adoption of the ideas which led to their being deposited with the
funeral urn, at a considerably later period than that of the rude hand-made
pottery of the early tumuli.</p>

</div>

<p>In striking contrast to these minute sepulchral relics, many of the
Scottish cinerary urns are of an unusually large size. So far as my
opportunities of observation extend, it is much more common in Scotland
than either in England or on the Continent to meet with urns
measuring thirteen, fourteen, and even sixteen inches high. In the
cairns, more especially where several urns are grouped together, one
is very frequently much larger than the others, though not more
ornamented; for the pottery of the largest size is generally comparatively
plain. The woodcut represents one, now in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries, measuring 11&frac12; inches
in height. It was found within the area of
the modern Scottish capital, in digging for
the foundation of the north pier of the Dean
Bridge that spans a deep ravine through
which the Water of Leith finds its way to
the neighbouring port. Numerous cists and
urns have been discovered in the extension
of the New Town of Edinburgh towards the
sea, attesting the presence of a busy and ingenious native race in ages
long prior to the dawn of authentic history, on the same spot which
has formed the centre of nearly all the most memorable events in the
national annals in more recent centuries. Another urn in the Scottish
Museum, measuring 12&frac12; inches in height, was found near Abden
House, in the parish of Kinghorn, Fifeshire, in 1848, by workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
engaged in cutting through the rocks on the sea-shore, preparatory to
the formation of the Northern Railway. When discovered it lay in
an inverted position on the flat surface of the rock, at a depth of five
feet from the surface, and was full of ashes and burnt bones. In examples
discovered under similar circumstances, it is not unfrequently
observed that the inside of the urn exhibits considerable marks of
exposure to heat and smoke. The incinerated remains would appear
to have been carefully gathered together in a little heap while yet
the glowing embers had only partially consumed the bones, and over
this the inverted urn was laid, quenching the last fires that glowed
within the ashes once ardent with impetuous life.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 543px;">

</div>

<p>None of those examples of primitive Scottish pottery have been
accompanied by relics which would enable us to assign them with
absolute certainty to the period when the introduction of the metallurgic
arts had stimulated native skill and ingenuity into action;
unless perhaps in the case of the small cup found on Arthur Seat,
alongside of which I have reason to believe the bronze celt now in
my possession was found. But most of them, in all probability, do
belong to that period; nor is it at all improbable that the practice of
cremation may itself be traced to the same source from whence the
ingenious workers in stone learned to fuse the metallic ores, and
fashion them into every variety of form. There are not wanting,
however, numerous examples both of native domestic pottery and of
cinerary urns, found along with relics which leave no room to question
their belonging to the Bronze Period. The larger of the two vases
represented in the annexed woodcut
was discovered under a tumulus at
Memsie, Aberdeenshire, and beside
it lay a bronze leaf-shaped sword,
broken in two. It is scarcely a
quarter of an inch in thickness, and
otherwise exhibits in symmetrical
proportions and durable material the
evidences of experienced workmanship.
In style of ornament it differs
little from the ruder specimens of Celtic pottery. But from the
well-baked material and the unusual thinness of the ware, it furnishes
a good example of the highest perfection attained in the potter's
art prior to the introduction of the vitrified glazing which is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
for the first time in connexion with the relics of the latest Pagan
era. Some similarity of form may be traced between this vessel
and the larger of the two discovered in the cist at Banchory. It
is a peculiar shape, and no doubt designed for some special purpose,
possibly a pitcher for liquids&mdash;the Pictish <i>heather ale</i>, perchance,
of vulgar tradition,&mdash;while the shallower vase which accompanied
the former example would more fitly receive the solid food
provided to appease the anticipated cravings of the dead. Alongside
of the urn from Memsie another is figured belonging to the same
period, which was dug up in the parish of Ratho, a few miles from
Edinburgh. It was found filled with ashes and fragments of human
bones, mingled with which were the fragments of bronze rings, and
the handle of a small vessel of the same metal. Both of these specimens
of primitive fictile ware are now in the Scottish Museum. A
third, in the same collection, somewhat similar to the last, was discovered
in trenching a field near the old castle of Kineff, Kincardineshire.
A bronze spear lay beside it, and within it were found, mingled
with the ashes of the dead, two large bronze rings, possibly
designed to be worn as bracelets, and the broken and corroded fragments
of several others of smaller proportions.</p>

<p>The numerous discoveries of cinerary urns and sepulchral pottery
of various kinds, which have been made in Scotland, abundantly prove
the very extensive and long continued practice of the rite of cremation
by the early Britons. It is a just subject of regret that so very
limited a number of examples of these curious specimens of native
art have been preserved. The statistical accounts of nearly every
parish in Scotland report such discoveries, frequently in considerable
numbers. Many pass into private hands, to be forgotten and abandoned
to neglect and decay, when the transient influence of novelty
has passed away; many more are destroyed so soon as discovered.
To the casual observer they appear mere rude clay urns characterized
by little variety or art. A closer examination of them, however,
shews that they are divisible by periods, classes, and the adaptation
to various purposes; and it is hardly to be doubted that, with an
ample and systematically arranged collection, a much more minute
classification might become apparent. A more general diffusion of
knowledge on this subject will, it is to be hoped, aid in the accomplishment
of so desirable an end. With the hearty cooperation of
landed proprietors, clergy, and the educated classes who have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>fluence
in rural districts, it might be effected at little cost or trouble;
and it is impossible fully to anticipate the important inferences that
might become obvious, in relation to the primeval history of our
country, by such an accumulation of the productions of native archaic
art. Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, Roman, and medieval manufactures,
have all been patiently and enthusiastically traced back to their first
rude efforts. It is to the study of the infancy of medieval art especially
that the sculptors and painters of Germany, France, and England,
have now turned in their enthusiastic anticipations of a new revival.
Why should the infantile efforts of our own national ancestry be alone
deemed unworthy of regard, rude though they be, and little akin to
the favourite models of modern schools? They form an important
first-link in the history of native design, and manifestly were among
the earliest products of skilled labour and inventive ingenuity. It is
obvious, moreover, that the art must have been in use for many generations.
Amid the evidences of a thinly scattered population, examples
of it are still of very frequent occurrence, after all the ravages of the
spade and the plough. In these we trace its gradual improvement,
and from thence very effectually discover proofs of the progress of their
constructors. First in order is the shapeless hand-made urn, merely
dried in the sun. To this succeed the imperfect efforts at decoration
and symmetrical design, and also the subjection of the moist clay to
the process of the kiln. Then comes the important discovery of the
potter's wheel, in the train of which many other improvements follow.
Taste is displayed in a variety of forms and ornamental patterns. In
the source to which it is conceived some of the more complicated of
these designs are referrible, we have another evidence of civilizing arts.
Among the rarer contents of the British sepulchral mounds, fragments
of manufactured clothing have been repeatedly found. These appear
to have been invariably wrought with the knitting-needle, and in
their texture may be traced the various patterns of herring-bone,
chevron, and saltire work, as well as nearly all the more complicated
designs employed in ornamenting the contemporary pottery. After
a careful examination of the examples within my reach, I have little
doubt of this being the source of the earliest imitative ornamentation,
in advance of the first simple attempts at combinations of incised
lines. The subject will come again under review in a future chapter;
but, meanwhile, it may be noted here as suggestive of the possible first
source of decoration of the rude cinerary urn, that its fragile texture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
may have been strengthened by being surrounded with a platting of
cords or rushes, which, in tasteful hands, would assume the same
forms as in the work of the knitting needles, and thus lead to the
reproduction of such patterns by a more durable process on the clay.
Humboldt describes a similar practice which came under his notice
at the village of Maniquarez in South America, where the Indian
women fashioned their rude vessels out of a decomposed mica-slate,
which they bound together with twigs, and baked in the sun. It is
certain that very many of the indented patterns on British pottery
have been produced by the impress of twisted cords on the wet clay,&mdash;the
intentional imitation, it may be, of undesigned indentations
originally made by the platted net-work on ruder urns,&mdash;so simple and
yet so natural may be the source to which we must look for the first
glimmering dawn of British art. Painters have delighted to picture
the Grecian maiden tracing her lover's shadow on the wall. Perchance
some British artist may not think it beneath his pencil to restore to
us the aboriginal potter marvelling at the unsought beauty which his
own hands have wrought.</p>

<p>Along with such evidences of taste and inventive ingenuity as the
works of the primitive potter display, the increasing demands of progressive
civilisation also become apparent in the adaptation of vessels
to the various requirements of domestic convenience or luxury; the
clay-made pottery improves from the clumsy, friable, ill-baked urn,
into a vessel of light and durable consistency, fitted for all the common
purposes of fictile ware. To this extent it was carried during
the archaic era of native art to which we give the name of the Bronze
Period. It will be seen in a future section that it received further
improvements from native skill before it was superseded by more
ingenious arts indirectly derived from Roman civilisation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

PERSONAL ORNAMENTS.</h3>


<p>In nothing is the singular inequality so characteristic of archaic
art more strikingly apparent than in the contrast frequently observable
between the rude clay urn of the Scottish tumulus or cairn and the
valuable and beautiful relics which it contains. Many of the latter,
indeed, are scarcely admissible under any classification of archaic art.
They differ more in characteristic peculiarities of style than in inferiority
of design when compared with the relics of the Anglo-Roman
period. Reference has already been made to the probable sources
from whence the abundant supplies of gold were derived by the primitive
Caledonian metallurgist. But whencesoever they are assumed
to have been procured, the fact is unquestionable, that while silver
was exceedingly rare, if not, indeed, entirely unknown, until almost
the close of the Bronze Period, gold appears to have been one of the
very first metals wrought, and to have been obtained in such abundance
as to supply material for numerous personal ornaments of large
size and great weight.</p>

<p>But the skill and ingenuity of the primitive artist was not solely
confined to ornaments wrought in gold or bronze. The humblest materials
assumed new value by the aid of his ingenuity and taste; and
not a few of the personal ornaments of a comparatively late stage of
progression in the Bronze Period are still formed of stone, or of the
more easily wrought jet and bituminous shale. Beads and necklaces
of the latter materials are of very frequent occurrence, and while some
are characterized by little evidence of taste or ingenuity, many more
are the manifest products of experienced mechanical skill. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
especially we detect the evidence of the use of the turning-lathe, and
its ingenious adaptation to the production of a great variety of articles.
This we may fairly regard as another important step in advance of the
improvements already detected in the native fictile wares by the introduction
of the potter's wheel. Some antiquaries, indeed, have been
inclined to class those, as well as so many other evidences of native
skill, either among the direct products of Roman art, or as the fruits
of the civilizing influence resulting from intercourse with the Roman
colonists; but if previous evidences of the priority of the early
native eras are of the slightest value, the circumstances under which
many jet and shale ornaments and relics have been found leave no
room to doubt that they are the products of unaided native ingenuity
and mechanical skill. These materials, however, continued to be used
during the Anglo-Roman period, and to partake of the influences of
Italian art in the forms which they assumed. It therefore becomes
necessary to exercise the same care in discriminating between the
products of native and foreign taste in the relics of jet or shale, as in
those of the metals, or of glass and ivory. According to Solinus jet
was one of the articles of export from Britain; and Bede speaks of
British jet as abundant and highly valued.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> But from these evidences
of its later foreign use we may infer its early adoption for construction
of personal ornaments by the native Britons, among whom its
fitness for such purposes was very probably first recognised. The style
of many of the relics of this class found in the primitive cists and
cairns, and especially of those which are presumed to be female ornaments,
totally differs from Anglo-Roman or classic remains, and abundantly
confirms their native origin, already rendered so exceedingly
probable from their discovery in early sepulchral mounds. An interesting
discovery of such relics, made in the parish of Houstoun,
Renfrewshire, during the latter part of last century, is thus described
in the Old Statistical Account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When the country people were digging for stones to inclose their farms, they
met with several chests or coffins of flag-stones, set on their edges, sides, and ends,
and covered with the same sort of stones above, in which were many human bones
of a large size, and several skulls in some of them. In one was found many
trinkets of a jet black substance, some round, others round and oblong, and others
of a diamond shape, &amp;c., all perforated. Probably they were a necklace. There
was a thin piece, about two inches broad at one end, and perforated with many holes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>but narrow at the other; the broad end, full of holes, seemed to be designed for
suspending many trinkets as an ornament on the breast."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p></div>

<p>In 1841 a stone cist was discovered on the estate of Burgie, in the
parish of Rafford, Elginshire, which measured internally three feet in
length by two feet in breadth. It contained a skeleton, believed to
be that of a female from the small size of the bones, in a sitting
posture, and with the head in contact with the knees. Beside the
skeleton stood an urn ten inches high, rudely decorated with incised
lines; and alongside of it were found a ring of polished shale or cannel
coal, two and a half inches in diameter; four rhomboidal pieces of the
same material, the largest pair two inches long; two triangular pieces,
and about an hundred large beads, all perforated for the purpose of
being strung together for a necklace. Various other cists have been
discovered on the same estate, generally containing urns; but this is
believed to have been the only example of the ring and necklace of
polished shale.</p>

<p>A necklace formed in part of similar ornaments is now in the interesting
collection of Adam Arbuthnot, Esq., of Peterhead. It was
found a few years since in a tumulus in the parish of Cruden, Aberdeenshire,
and consists of alternate beads of jet and perforated but
irregular pieces of amber. The largest beads measure about four
inches in length, from which they diminish to about an inch. The
only other object beside them was a flint hatchet about seven inches
long; so that this curious example of primitive personal ornaments
may be assumed to belong to the earliest period, or perhaps to that
of the transition from stone to metallic weapons and implements.</p>

<p>On opening a cairn on the hill of Auchmacher, Aberdeenshire, about
1790, an urn was exposed, in the mouth of which lay a number of
circular perforated beads of black shale.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> About the same period
another urn was dug up in the parish of Ceres, Fifeshire, within
which a smaller one was inclosed, and in it, in addition to the incinerated
remains, lay a small brass implement, probably a hair-pin,
(described as resembling a shoemaker's awl,) and a small black bead
cut in diamond form.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/image294.jpg" width="599" height="279" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Jet Necklace, Ross-shire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Various interesting personal ornaments obtained under similar
circumstances, are preserved in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
and one set in particular, found inclosed in an urn within
a rude stone cist, on the demolition of a tumulus near the Old
House of Assynt, Ross-shire, in 1824, very closely correspond in appearance
to the description of the Renfrewshire relics. They include
a necklace of irregular oval jet beads, which appear to have been
strung together like a common modern string of beads, and are sufficiently
rude to correspond with the works of a very primitive era.
The other ornaments which are represented here, about one-fourth the
size of the original, are curiously studded with gold spots, arranged in
patterns similar to those with which the rude pottery of the British
tumuli are most frequently decorated, and the whole are perforated
with holes, passing obliquely from the back through the edge, evidently
designed for attaching them to each other by means of threads.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Several other urns were discovered in a large cairn, a few miles
distant from the tumulus which contained these interesting and tasteful
relics of female adornment, as they are with great probability assumed
to be; though it is well known that the modes of personal decoration
which modern taste and refinement reserve for the fair sex are
very differently apportioned in ruder states of society. The comparative
anatomist can alone absolutely determine this question by future observations
on the bones discovered along with similar remains. Meanwhile
these examples are of peculiar value from the conclusion previously
assumed by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, after examination of various
sepulchral deposits containing similar relics, that the female barrow
very rarely contains urns. Another sepulchral deposit of similar personal
ornaments, including two fibulæ or discs of bituminous shale
measuring one and a half inches in diameter, found in a grave at
Letham, was presented to the Scottish Museum in 1820 by Sir David
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Brewster. It probably formed a portion of the contents of a group of
cists discovered in a round gravel knoll or tumulus, near the Den of
Letham, and described in the New Statistical Account of Dunnichen
Parish, Forfarshire. They contained urns of red clay with rude ornaments
upon them, and human bones irregularly disposed. "The
neck-bones of some were adorned with strings of beads of a beautiful
glossy black colour, neatly perforated longitudinally, and strung together
by the fibres of animals. They were of an oval figure; large
and small ones were arranged alternately, the large ones flat on the
two opposite surfaces, the small ones round. They seemed to consist
of ebony, or of some fine-grained wood which had been charred and
then finely polished. On keeping them some time they split into
plates, and the woody fibres separated. In some of these graves rusty
daggers were found, which fell in pieces by handling."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> One is almost
tempted to challenge the completeness of this account, and to
suspect the position of the necklaces, and perhaps the fibre-strings
also, to be creations of the statist's imagination, more especially as the
graves contained no perfect skeleton, but only loose bones. The woodcut
represents a fibula of
the same material, in the
possession of James Drummond,
Esq. It is drawn
one-half the size of the original,
which was recently
found in a moss at Crawford
Moor, near Carstairs,
Lanarkshire. Simple as its form is it is not unfamiliar to the British
antiquary. Sir R. C. Hoare describes and figures one exactly similar,
found on opening a bell-shaped barrow at Blandford, and examples
are referred to in the Ancient Wiltshire and other works.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
Whether we regard this uniformity of type as evidence of the extent
of intercourse anciently carried on among the most widely severed
tribes, or of some system by which such relics were diffused by the
wandering trader throughout the whole British islands, such comparisons
cannot fail to interest the student of primitive history, trifling
though they may appear, and to stimulate him to further investigation
of such analogies.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 641px;">

<p>English antiquaries have long been familiar with relics of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>class, under the local name of ornaments of Kimmeridge Coal, and
also with a more mysterious variety formed of the same material,
on which the name of "Kimmeridge Coal Money" was conferred,
from the idea that these symmetrical pieces of shale were used as a
circulating medium before the introduction of the metals. The
material of which the whole of this class of relics are composed has
obviously been applied to the manufacture of personal ornaments
from a very remote era, though the so-called coal money probably
belongs to a comparatively late period. Some interesting examples
of necklaces and other ornaments, precisely similar in style and
character to those found in the Renfrew, Ross, and Fifeshire tumuli,
were discovered on opening some Derbyshire barrows in 1846. These
"female decorations of Kimmeridge coal," as they are styled in the
account of the discovery in the Journal of the Archæological Association,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
were deposited beside a female skeleton, in a cist formed of
large stones. "The other instruments found on this occasion were
all of flint, not the least fragment of metallic substance being visible.
The ornament appears to have been a kind of necklace, with a central
decoration, enriched by bone or ivory plates, ornamented with the
chevron pattern so prevalent on articles of presumed Celtic manufacture,
terminating with two laterally perforated studs of the coal; the
remainder of the ornament consists of two rows of bugle-shaped
beads of the same material." A few days later, two more necklaces,
of similar design and material, were found in a cist under a barrow
in the same county, in like manner accompanied only with implements
of flint and bone. Engravings of some of these relics accompany
the narrative of their discovery; and their remarkable similarity
to those of the early Scottish tumuli, leaves no doubt that both
belong to the same period. It is remarked of the Derbyshire relics
by their discoverer,&mdash;"On the most superficial examination, it is
quite evident that these articles have never received their form from
the lathe, as the armlets of Kimmeridge coal are clearly proved to
have done. This, coupled with the fact that the perforation through
the length of the bead is in no instance carried through from one
end, but is bored each way towards the centre, (as would be the case
if a rude drill of flint were used for the purpose,) bespeaks a far more
remote period than the one in which the use of the lathe was prevalent."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Both the unsymmetrical form, and the perforation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>beads found in the Ross-shire tumulus, fully correspond with these
in the indications of the imperfect skill and rude instruments of their
manufacturers. But the slow progress of native art was first aided,
as we have seen, by the introduction of the potter's wheel; and from
this, in all probability, originated the more ingenious contrivance of
the turning-lathe. Whencesoever derived, its influence is abundantly
apparent on the later relics of native art.</p>

<p>The "coal money" of the elder school of English antiquaries is
found almost exclusively in two little secluded valleys at Purbeck, on
the southern coast of Dorsetshire, known as Kimmeridge and Worthbarrow
Bays. Similar relics, however, it will be seen, are not unknown
in Scotland, though designated by other names than the local
term derived from Kimmeridge Bay. They consist of flat circular
pieces of shale, with bevelled and moulded edges, varying in size from
1&frac14; to nearly 3 inches in diameter, and frequently perforated or indented
with one or more holes. The actual purpose for which this
coinage of the Kimmeridge Mint was destined, long formed an antiquarian
riddle, which baffled the acutest English archæologists; for
the popular name was rather adopted as a convenient term, than
seriously regarded as properly applicable to articles so fragile and
valueless. One ingenious but somewhat fanciful theorist did, indeed,
attempt to prove these relics to be the work of Ph&#339;nician artists,
designed, not as an actual circulating medium, "but as representatives
of coin, and of some mystical use in sacrificial or sepulchral
rites!" All such ideas, however, are now entirely exploded, and it is
no longer doubted that these are the waste pieces produced in the
formation of rings from the shale on the turning-lathe. The fragments
of pottery, and other relics discovered along with these curious
exuviæ of early art, leave little room to doubt that during the
Anglo-Roman period a manufacture of amulets, beads, and other
personal ornaments of Kimmeridge shale, must have been carried on
to a considerable extent in the Isle of Purbeck.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The popular idea of the use of such circular pieces of shale as
money is found attached to them in Scotland as well as in England.
In the account of the parish of Portpatrick, it is remarked,&mdash;"Circular
pieces, from two to three inches diameter, cut out of a black slate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
not found in the parish, are frequently dug up in the churchyard, along
with rings out of which these pieces seem to have been cut. Both of
these are supposed by the people here to have been used as money."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Similar relics have been found in Kirkcudbright and other southern
shires; and Mr. Joseph Train describes others, not greatly differing in
character, found near the large moat or tumulus on the farm of Hallferne,
parish of Crossmichael, where also a beautiful Druidical bead
was discovered, nearly an inch in diameter, composed of pale-coloured
glass, with a waving stripe of yellow round the circumference.
In Kirkcudbrightshire, these ornaments of shale have
retained nearly to our own day the same rank in popular estimation
for their medicinal virtues, or supernatural powers, as we find
ascribed to the ornaments and amulets of jet among the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
Mr. Train remarks,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There have been found, at different times, near the same moat, several round
flat stones, each five or six inches diameter, perforated artificially in the centre.
Even within the memory of some persons yet alive, these perforated stones were
used in Galloway to counteract the supposed effects of witchcraft, particularly in
horses and black cattle. 'The cannie wife o' Glengappoch put a boirt stane into
ane tub filled with water, and causit syne the haill cattell to pass by, and, when
passing, springled ilk ane o' them with a besome dipped in it.' One of these perforated
stones, as black and glossy as polished ebony, is also in my possession. It
was recently found in the ruins of an old byre, where it had evidently been placed
for the protection of the cattle."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p></div>

<p>Ure remarks in his History of Kilbride, "a ring of a hard black
schistous, found in a cairn in the parish of Inchinan, has performed,
if we believe report, many astonishing cures. It is to this day preserved
in the parish as an inestimable specific."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Similar proofs of
the superstitious reverence attached to these ancient relics are by no
means rare.</p>

<p>From evidence already referred to, it is abundantly obvious that
ornaments both of shale and jet were in use at the period of the
Roman colonization of Britain, and this is further confirmed by their
discovery along with Anglo-Roman sepulchral remains. Most of those,
however, exhibit a degree of finish and ornamentation which dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>tinguishes
them from works in the same materials of an older date.
Still it is the more needful to examine with care the circumstances
under which the latter have been found, and to ascertain, if possible,
whether they are contemporary works of ruder execution, or really
pertain to an earlier era. Relics of this class, it is obvious, are by no
means uncommon; and it is with a view to the discrimination of
those of native origin from the later products of foreign art, that so
many examples are here referred to.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Sibbald thus notices the occurrence of rings or armlets of
shale in Scottish sepulchral mounds:&mdash;"Some full circles, of a black
colour, very smooth, two or three inches in diameter, are found in the
cairns or burroughs. They are very light, and when fire is put to them
they burn and give a good smell, and seem to be made of odoriferous
gums."<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Mr. Ure appears to have tried the same costly experiment,
and remarks as its result, that they burn with a clear flame.
There formerly existed in the district of Logie, Forfarshire, a remarkable
group of tumuli, called the Three Laws of Logie; which
agricultural operations have since nearly obliterated. On opening
one of these, it proved to contain four human skeletons, near to which
was one of the above relics, described "as a beautiful ring, supposed
to be of ebony, as black as jet, of a fine polish, and in perfect
preservation. It is of a circular form, flat in the inside, and rounded
without. Its circumference is about twelve inches, and its diameter
four inches."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> A large cairn, in the parish of East Kilbride, bore
the name of Queen Mary's Mount, from the tradition that the unhappy
Queen witnessed from its summit the Battle of Langside, and
beheld the sceptre of a kingdom pass for ever from her grasp. But
such touching historical associations could not suffice to rescue the
venerable memorial from the hands of the destroyer. For years it
supplied the whole neighbouring districts with materials for building
stone fences, until some workmen employed in removing the remaining
stones, in 1792, discovered a chamber containing about twenty-five
urns full of earth and human bones. These urns, some of which
have been engraved in Ure's History, were of the most primitive
shape and character, "rudely formed, seemingly with no other instrument
than the hand, and so soft as easily to be scratched with the
nail. They were of different sizes, mostly about twelve inches deep,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>and six wide at the mouth. None of them were destitute of ornaments;
but these were extremely rude, and seem to have been done
in a hurry, with a sharp-pointed instrument. They were all placed
with their mouths undermost upon flat stones; and a piece of white
quartz was found in the centre of the mouth of each, larger and
smaller, in proportion to the dimensions of the several urns."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> A
cist of about four feet square was placed exactly in the centre of the
cairn, near to which was a bronze fibula of extremely rude form;
another, still simpler in design, was found in one of the urns, and a
bronze comb, equally characteristic of primitive arts, in a second;
while alongside of them lay one of the rings of bituminous shale. The
bronze relics are all engraved by Ure, so that a tolerably perfect idea
can be formed of their design and workmanship. He pronounces
them, according to the fashion of his time, to be Roman, but they
bear no resemblance to the rudest specimens of Anglo-Roman art.
Similar ornaments of shale have been discovered both in the Northern
and Western Isles, furthest removed from Roman arts and influence.
One example, which is here engraved
one half the natural size,
was found in the Isle of Skye,
and presented to the Scottish
Society of Antiquaries in 1782.
It is supposed to be designed for
the clasp of a belt. Two rings of the same material, each measuring 3&frac12;
inches in diameter, were discovered about two years later on the same
island, and added to the Scottish Museum. Another, four inches in
diameter, flat on the inside, and rounded without, as is most frequently
the case, was obtained from a tumulus in the parish of Logie, Forfarshire,
along with an urn full of ashes, and the remains of four skeletons.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
In 1832, some labourers levelling a sandy field at Dubbs, in
the parish of Stevenston, Ayrshire, came upon a paved area five feet
under the surface, measuring six yards long and two broad. Across
the one end lay a stone of about a ton weight, and at the other
there was found a stone cist, measuring three feet in length by two
in breadth. Within it were two urns, one of gray and the other of
black pottery, both apparently filled only with earth, and beside
them lay five studs or buttons of different sizes, formed of highly
polished jet. The urns were broken, but the studs were preserved
by the late Colonel Hamilton. They are convex on the one side,
and concave on the other, with knobs left in the latter, seemingly for
attaching them to the dress. The largest is more than an inch in
diameter.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Two other rings of polished shale, similar to those
already described, were discovered in 1786, lying beside a skeleton,
on removing a large flat stone within the area of one of those circular
towers in Caithness, commonly termed burghs, or Pictish Forts.
Beside them lay a bone pin, and two fine oval brooches, (the <i>Skaalformet</i>
<i>Spande</i> of Danish antiquaries,) such as have been frequently
discovered in the Northern and Western Isles, and are now generally
ascribed to the era of the Vikings.</p>

<p>Such examples, it is obvious, might be greatly multiplied, but
enough have been cited to enable us to trace the use of those ornaments
from probably the earliest years of the Bronze Period to the close
of the latest Pagan era. The rings, which form the most common
articles manufactured of shale, have been usually considered as armlets,
but it is very doubtful if such was their real use. Many of them, indeed,
are too small to admit of the hand passing through them, and rings
of similar size and form are discovered of various other materials. One
in the Scottish Museum, apparently of glazed earthenware, and measuring
nearly three inches in diameter, was found under a large cairn at
Bogheads, Kintore parish, Aberdeenshire, in 1789, and beside it lay
four oblong squared pieces of polished shale, the two largest two
inches in length, the other two an inch and a half, and an inch
broad. Between each pair were three oval beads of the same substance,
nearly an inch long. They were described, when presented to
the Society, as having been suspended from the ring; but it is more
probable that they formed, as in other cases, a separate necklace. A
number of cairns, some of them of very large dimensions, still remain
on the extensive moor which occupies a considerable area in both the
parishes of Kinellar and Kintore. Another ring in the same collection,
formed of a white translucent stone, was found on the Flanders Moss,
Perthshire; and a third made of hard dark wood, 3&frac12; inches in diameter,
and 1&frac34; inches broad, was discovered near a cairn on the north
side of Hatlock, in Tweeddale, on first subjecting the neighbouring
heath to the plough in 1784. It has been suggested that these rings
formed part of the female head gear, through which the hair was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
drawn; and a sculptured female head, found at Bath, is referred to,
on which an ornament somewhat resembling them is represented so
applied.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The discovery of such rings alongside of female ornaments,
such as the necklaces and pendants already described, seems to justify
the classification of them among objects of mere personal adornment;
and where found singly, their supposed use in the arrangement of the
long locks of their owners furnishes a very feasible explanation of
the purpose for which they were designed. Nevertheless, the frequency
of their occurrence, under a great variety of circumstances,
suggests the idea that these rings may possess a higher value as the
records of long obsolete rites and customs, than pertains to the mere
objects of personal adornment. They have been found accompanying
female ornaments, and apparently with female remains; but they
have also been discovered no less certainly in the sepulchres of warriors
and chiefs, and under cairns which seem to mark the last resting-place
of those who fell in the grim strife of war. We shall not
perhaps greatly err, if we trace in these relics of such frequent occurrence
something analogous to the sacramental ring of the Scandinavians,
described in the Eyrbiggia-Saga, and referred to in a former
chapter in illustration of the perforated stone at Stennis, in Orkney,
and the vow of Odin of which it was the seal. Dr. Hibbert has
already observed on this subject,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In Iceland a less bulky ring for the ratification of engagements was introduced.
Within the hof was a division, like a choir in a church, where stood an elevation
in the middle of the floor, and an altar. Upon the altar was placed a ring, without
any joint, of the value of two oras. These rings (idly named Druidical amulets)
are variously formed of bone, of jet, of stone, and even of the precious metals.
Some are so wide as to allow the palm of the hand to be passed through them,
which rings were used when parties entered into mutual compacts. In a woodcut
given in an old edition of Olaus Magnus, the solemnization of a betrothing contract
is represented by the bridegroom passing his four fingers and palm through a large
ring, and in this manner receiving the hand of the bride. This is similar to the
mode practised in Orkney, where contracting parties join hands through the perforation,
or more properly speaking the ring, of a stone pillar. In the oath administered
to an individual as a test of veracity, it was sufficient that he held in his
hand a ring of small size, dipped in the blood of sacrificial victims."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
</p></div>

<p>An illustration of the mode of administering such an oath occurs in
Viga Glum's Saga. In the midst of a wedding party Glum calls upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>Thorarin, his accuser, to hear his oath, and taking in his hand a silver
ring, which had been dipped in sacrificial blood, he cites two witnesses
to testify to his oath on the ring, and his having appealed to the gods
in his denial of the charge. These customs belong to a more recent
era than that to which we refer the Scottish Bronze Period. But it
is impossible to say to how remote an era we must look for their
origin, or how long before the time of the Vikings, the Scandinavian
and Celtic races, as well as their Allophylian precursors, had been familiar
in their common cradle-land in the far east, with rites and usages
from which the sacredness of this sacramental ring may have sprung.</p>

<p>Viewed in this light the frequent occurrence of such relics in the
cist, or under the memorial cairn, may be pregnant with a far higher
meaning than the mere ornamental fibula or amulet. When found
with the spear and sword, the ring may indicate the grave of the
warrior-priest or lawgiver,&mdash;a union of offices so consistent with society
in a primitive state; while, in the female barrow, amid the bracelets
and necklaces which once adorned the primitive British matron, the
curious relic may, with no undue indulgence of fancy, be looked
upon as the spousal pledge, and the literal wedding-ring. It seems,
indeed, most probable, that the little golden ring with which, in these
modern centuries, we wed, is none other than the symbolic memorial
of the old sacramental ring which witnessed the vows of our rude
island fathers, and was made the pledge of their plighted troth. This,
however, is perhaps trespassing beyond the pale of legitimate induction
into the seductive regions of fancy, where antiquaries have too
frequently chosen to wander at their own sweet will.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 627px;">
<img src="images/image303.jpg" width="627" height="333" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In some degree akin to
the personal ornaments
of jet and shale are the
large beads of glass or
vitreous paste, and amber,
so well known among
the contents of British
tumuli, and associated
even in our own day,
with the same superstitious
virtues ascribed to them in the writings of the philosophic
but credulous Pliny. The very same story, in fact, is told of the
<i>Adder-stane</i> in the popular legends of the Scottish Lowlands as Pliny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
records of the origin of the <i>Ovum Anguinum</i>. The various names by
which these relics are designated all point to their estimation as
amulets or superstitious charms, and the fact of their occurrence, most
frequently singly, in the sepulchral cist or urn, seems to prove that
it was as such, and not merely as personal ornaments, that they were
deposited along with the ashes of the dead. They are variously known
as Adder Beads, Serpent Stones, Druidical Beads, and among the
Welsh and Irish by the synonymous terms of <i>Gleini na Droedh</i>, and
<i>Glaine nan Druidhe</i>, signifying the Magician's or Druid's glass.
Many of them are exceedingly beautiful, and are characterized by
considerable ingenuity in the variations of style. Among those in
the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries there is one of red glass,
spotted with white; another of dark brown glass, streaked with
yellow; others of pale green and blue glass, plain and ribbed; and
two of curiously figured patterns, wrought with various colours interwoven
on their surface.
The specimens engraved
here are selected from
these. Among a curious
collection of antiquities
discovered in a barrow on
Barnham Downs, and exhibited
by Lord Landesborough
at a meeting of
the Society of Antiquaries of London, March 7, 1850, there was a large
glass bead, which had been broken and ingeniously repaired with a hoop
of bronze,&mdash;a significant indication of the great value attached to it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 597px;">
<img src="images/image304.jpg" width="597" height="307" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Beads of amber, stone, clay, and porcelain, as well as of horn and
bone, are all more or less common among the early sepulchral deposits,
and may be regarded with little hesitation as of native
workmanship. Amber, though not indigenous to this country, is
of sufficiently frequent occurrence to abundantly account for its use
in the manufacture of personal ornaments, without assuming its importation
from the Baltic, where it most largely abounds. Both
Boece<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and Camden notice the finding of pieces of extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>size at Buchanness, on the coast of Aberdeenshire. The clergyman
of the parish of Peterhead, in the same county, in drawing up an account
of his parish for Sir John Sinclair, mentions having in his possession
"a pretty large piece of amber," recently found on the sea-beach
near the manse; and in 1783, Mr. George Paton presented to
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland two pieces found on the sea-shore
in the Frith of Forth, near Queensferry. The fact, indeed, of
amber being obtained in the greatest quantities on the southern
coasts of the Baltic Sea, is abundantly sufficient to account for its
also frequently occurring in smaller quantities on the east coast of
Scotland. It appears accordingly to have formed one of the most
favourite articles for adorning and setting brooches, hair-pins, and
other personal ornaments, from the earliest practice of the jeweller's
art, until our native tastes and customs were merged, by increasing
intercourse with other nations, into the common characteristics of
later medieval art.</p>

<p>The source from whence the "Adder Beads" were derived is more
difficult of solution. The most probable means of accounting for
their introduction to Britain is by the Ph&#339;nicians, or by traders in
direct communication with that people, whose early skill in the
manufacture of glass is familiar to us, and to whom we in all probability
owe the initiative suggestions and examples which originated
the most important improvements characteristic of the period now
under consideration. Still it must be borne in remembrance, that
after all we know extremely little, and almost nothing precise or definite,
concerning Ph&#339;nician intercourse with Britain. Druids, Picts,
and Danes have all been very convenient names which have too often
saved Scottish antiquaries, and indeed English antiquaries also, the
trouble of reasoning, and helped to conceal the fact, from themselves
as well as others, that they really knew nothing about the questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>they undertook to discuss. If we merely substitute for these the
name of the Ph&#339;nicians little indeed will be gained by the exchange.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton has undertaken to prove the Italian workmanship
of the glass beads found in Britain, on the very slender
evidence of the discovery of one at Naples similar to British examples.
They have undoubtedly been found both in England and Scotland
accompanied with Roman relics, though much more frequently in
native sepulchres apparently long prior to the Anglo-Roman era.
Ure describes and engraves one of ribbed blue glass&mdash;bearing considerable
resemblance to another in the Scottish Museum from the Isle of
Skye&mdash;which was discovered in a large inclosed tumulus in Rutherglen
parish, Lanarkshire, along with what appear to have been two
Roman patellæ.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> But the same relics have been found along the
coasts of the Baltic and the Mediterranean; they abound equally in
Ireland and the north of Scotland, where the Romans rarely or never
were, and in England and Gaul, which they so long occupied and
colonized. They have been obtained also not unfrequently in Egyptian
catacombs accompanying relics long prior to the Roman era.
Raspe, in his introduction to Tassie's Gems, refers to the so-called
Druid's beads as belonging to the same class as the "rich coloured
glass and enamels found amongst the Egyptian antiquities;" and
Colonel Howard Vyse mentions them among the numerous relics
found in exploring "Campbell's Tomb" at Gizeh, which appears to
have been constructed during the reign of Psammetichus II., about
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 600. But indeed the most conclusive and altogether incontrovertible
evidence of the remote antiquity to which these singular and
widely-diffused relics belong, is to be found in the fact, that their
origin and virtues were the subjects of the same superstitious fables
in the age of Pliny, as in the British folk-lore of the eighteenth
century. We shall not, I think, overstep the limits of fair induction
in viewing these beads as affording another proof of the extensive,
though probably indirect intercourse, by means of which the races of
the north of Europe participated in the reflex of southern civilisation
many centuries before we can trace any allusion to them in the
world's elder literature; unless where the fond Briton seeks to include
his sea-girt home amid "the isles of the Gentiles" of the
Hebrew Scriptures, or dimly discerns them in the Cassiterides of
Herodotus. It should be noted, in connexion with this subject, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>other glass relics have occasionally been found among the contents of
British tumuli, though much too rarely to afford any countenance to
the idea of a primitive native manufacture of glass. One imperfect
example in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, found in a cist
in the island of Westray, Orkney, apparently deposited on the breast of
the deceased, is described by its donor as "the only specimen hitherto
discovered of glass contained in these cemeteries." It appears to have
been a cup, not improbably of Roman manufacture, the bottom of
which is marked with concentric circles in relief. The extreme rarity
of such articles probably characterizes this as another example of the
ungrudging generosity of affectionate reverence for the deceased, no less
marked than the more valued sepulchral deposits of the precious metals.</p>

<p>Of the beautiful gold and silver relics exposed from time to time
on the opening of Scottish sepulchral tumuli, or brought to light in
the course of agricultural operations, only the most trifling moiety
has escaped the clutches of ignorant cupidity. But even the few existing
specimens are sufficient to excite the deepest sorrow that such
works of early native art, frequently characterized by a style altogether
unique, and exceedingly beautiful in design and ornament,
should be discovered only to be destroyed. Some idea of the great
variety of Scottish gold relics may be formed even from the few examples
preserved or minutely described; but a much greater number
might be noted which are known to have been destroyed, without any
opportunity having been afforded even of accurately observing their
form, or learning of the circumstances under which they were discovered.
The plain gold armillæ from Banffshire, already referred to,
and engraved along with the urn in which they lay, in the Archæologia
Scotica,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> furnish sufficiently rude specimens of primitive personal
ornaments. Though it can hardly admit of a doubt that they
have been designed as armillæ or bracelets, yet the difference in weight,
and even more in apparent bulk, sufficiently illustrates the inexperience
of their maker. Their respective weights are&mdash;1 oz. 5 dwts.
14 grs., and 1 oz. 14 grs. But along with them were examples of one
of the simplest yet most interesting class of gold relics discovered in
the British Isles. These are described in the Archæologia Scotica as
nose and ear-rings, but they are simply formed of bars of gold bent
in a circular form, and the extremities left disunited. Two of them
are ornamented with parallel grooves along the outer side, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>are of unequal sizes, and in no degree differ from the numerous class
of penannular relics now designated by most antiquaries as "ring-money";
though the idea of their use as nose-rings had been formerly
advanced by Colonel Vallancey,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and has been more than once
revived.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> In a valuable article by Mr. Albert Way, on the ornaments
of gold discovered in the British Islands, examples of British ring-money
are engraved, including the simple penannular ornament, the
crescent, and beaded and torquated rings.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> It is not necessary to
enter at large on the disputed question of the use of these relics as
currency. Many ingenious, and as I think satisfactory arguments,
have been adduced in favour of their original purpose as a circulating
medium; though this was in no degree incompatible with their use
as personal ornaments. That such rings passed for money among the
Egyptians is proved by representations of the weighing of gold and
silver ring-money on their paintings; as, for example, in one of the
grottos in the hill of Shek Abd el Qoorneh, which bears the cartouche
of Amunoph II. inscribed on its walls. The same metallic currency is
obviously alluded to in the incident of the Hebrew patriarchs on their
first visit to Egypt: "Every man's money was in the mouth of his
sack, our money <i>in full weight</i>." It was perhaps even better suited
than a regular coinage for furnishing an acceptable substitute for
barter among a comparatively rude people, and may therefore be assumed
with considerable probability as one of the improvements
resulting from intercourse with the Ph&#339;nician traders. Such a
system of exchange will also suffice to account for one foreign source
of the abundant supply of gold during this primitive era; thus introduced
in a form well suited to the imperfect ideas of a people whose
trade probably long retained more of the original character of barter
than that of sale and purchase, and who would receive the gold rings
only as so much metal. There is reason to believe, however, that both
in Scotland and Ireland the ring-money continued in use long after
Cunobeline and other British princes had sought to rival the Roman
mintage. In the Irish annals there is frequent mention of gold rings
of different sizes offered at the shrines of Icolmkill, St. Patrick, &amp;c.
The inferior metals appear also to have been current in this simple
form. Rings of bronze, exactly corresponding to the gold "ring-money"
have been found both in the ruins of Persepolis and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>Carthage, as well as in Egypt. They are well known to Irish antiquaries,
and are probably more common in Scotland than is generally
supposed. The imperfect bronze rings already referred to among the
contents of a cinerary urn dug up in the parish of Ratho, Mid-Lothian,
are of this description; and similar relics are occasionally described
among the contents of the weems or subterranean dwellings. In
1835 a large tumulus, near the summit of Carmylie Hill, Forfarshire,
popularly known as the "Fairy Hillock," was invaded, and among a
deposit of half-burnt bones and charcoal several penannular bronze
rings were discovered, varying in size from about two inches to two-thirds
of an inch in diameter. They are quite plain, as if they had
been formed by simply cutting and bending into shape a rod of
bronze wire. This ancient and primitive form of currency which we
detect along with the first elements of British civilisation, has perhaps
never ceased to be used in some parts of the African continent since
that remote era when it sufficed for payment of the exactions of the
Egyptian Pharaohs. Mr. Way remarks,&mdash;"I am indebted to the
Duke of Northumberland for the opportunity of examining specimens
of African gold money, especially interesting as having been made
under his own inspection at Sennaar. His Grace favoured me with
the following particulars:&mdash;He chanced to notice a blacksmith occupied
in forming these rings; and inquiring as to their use, the man
replied, that having no work in hand for his forge he was making
money. The gold wire being very flexible was bent into rings without
precise conformity in regard to weight, and was thus converted
into money. It passed current by weight. The gold is so flexible
that the rings are readily opened, to be linked into a chain for the
convenience of keeping them together, and as readily detached when
a payment was to be made."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Manillas, as they are now generally
termed, are regularly manufactured at Birmingham for the African
traders. They are made of copper, or of an alloy of copper and iron,
and are sold at the rate of &pound;105 per ton for copper, and &pound;22 for iron
rings. The copper ring weighs two and a half ounces, and passes
current in Africa at a value equivalent to fourpence sterling. The
Banffshire gold relics furnish examples both of plain and grooved ring-money.
Of the former class one of about &pound;2 value is described
in the Old Statistical Account, found at Tiree, Argyleshire, in 1792.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
Mr. Paton of Dunfermline possesses a gold torquated ring, obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>in that neighbourhood. Another, found in one of the weems or subterranean
dwellings on the island of Shapinshay, Orkney, "composed,
as it were, of three cords twisted or plaited together," is minutely described
in the Statistical Account of the parish;<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and in the London
Numismatic Society's Museum, African gold relics, exactly corresponding
to these, are preserved among the primitive types of coinage.
Plated rings of similar form have also been occasionally discovered
both in Scotland and Ireland, which it is more difficult to conceive of
as a substitute for current coin, unless we assume the perverse ingenuity
of the forger, usually ranked among the vices of modern
civilisation, to be even as ancient as the era of British ring-money.
One of these composite penannular relics, in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries, was found in the Isle of Skye. It is of copper,
covered with a thick plating of pure gold, and when perfect must have
bid defiance to detection of its internal inferiority. It is thicker than
the usual ring-money, so that the gold has been forced into folds or
wrinkles on the inner side in bending it into shape.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The most simple gold ornaments of larger size found in the British
Islands are the massive rings with dilated ends, disunited, but generally
brought nearly in contact, which are of frequent occurrence in
connexion with the rarer objects of the Bronze Period. They are
generally assumed to have been worn as armillæ, and to have their
ends disunited for the convenience of the wearer. One strong objection
to this supposition is to be found in the frequent extension of
the dilated edges of the two ends to the inner side of the ring, in a
way that must have rendered them exceedingly uncomfortable if worn
as armlets.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> This is the case with one of two fine examples preserved
in the Scottish Museum, both found in the same cist at Alloa in 1828;
and such also appears from drawings in my possession to be the form
of several of a remarkable group discovered in January of the present
year (1850) at Bowes, near Barnard Castle, Yorkshire. Relics of the
same character, though differing in detail, are found under similar
circumstances in Denmark. The dilation of the ends in the examples
preserved in the palace of Christiansborg, at Copenhagen, is much
more conspicuous than in the British type, being in the form of cones
attached by the narrow end to the annular bar of gold, and therefore
still less adapted for being worn on the arm. Some specimens are
found without this peculiarity, the dilation being only outward, as
in one found near Patcham, Sussex, engraved in the Archæological
Journal,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> and another almost exactly corresponding in form, but
considerably thicker, found in Galloway in 1784, and of which a
drawing is possessed by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.
These rings are generally much too massive and rigid, notwithstanding
the purity and consequent softness of the gold, to admit of
their being unbent for the purpose of clasping on the arm, without
injuring their form and leaving marks of such a process; in addition
to which, another though less conclusive argument against their use
as armillæ is, that they are rarely if ever found in pairs. A gold
relic, seemingly of this class, was discovered in 1794, on opening a
large sepulchral mound at Upper Dalachie, Banffshire, popularly
styled the Green Cairn. "About two feet from the surface," says
Chalmers,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> "was found an urn
of rude workmanship, which,
when the ashes of the dead
were shaken out, disclosed a
piece of polished gold like the
handle of a vase, three inches
in diameter, and more than
one-eighth of an inch thick."
The finder sold this relic for
bullion, at the price of thirteen
guineas. Where two or more
occur together, they generally differ both in size and form, as well as
in weight. The two found in the same cist at Alloa,&mdash;the largest of
which is here represented, half the size of the original,&mdash;differ in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>these respects; and the same is the case with those recently discovered
at Bowes,&mdash;no two of the whole six correspond, though they
all lay close together, with what was thought to be the remains of a
bag in which they had been inclosed. This will be apparent from
the following table of their weights:&mdash;</p>

<p>The quality in the metal of the two last, though found in the same
locality, greatly differs, the first being largely alloyed with silver.
The weights of several other English examples are given by Mr. Way,
in his interesting contribution to the Archæological Journal.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The
record of the precise weights of these curious relics may help to test
the theory which has been occasionally advanced, that they also
belong to the class of primitive currency; since a uniform rule of
subdivision by weight has been thought discoverable in relation to
Irish ring-money. The idea, however, seems altogether untenable
with reference to these larger rings. The simplicity and gracefulness
of the form adhered to, with very slight variations, in a relic of
such frequent occurrence, while armillæ, torcs, and even the small
penannular rings supposed to have formed the currency of these
primitive metallurgists, exhibit so many varieties and modes of
decoration, seem rather to point out the former as appropriated to
some peculiar and perhaps sacred purpose. What that was we shall
probably never know. One example, indeed, found near Aspatria, in
Cumberland, in 1828, not only differs in being slightly ornamented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>with circular lines and small notches, but certain antiquaries discerned
and undertook to read a supposed Runic inscription upon it.
It has accordingly been engraved, both in the Archæologia (vol. xxii.
p. 439) and in the Archæologia Æliana (vol. ii. p. 268.) But it seems
probable that it must rank with the more celebrated Runamo inscription,
which, after being proved to be in "the old northern or
Icelandic tongue, in regular alliterative verse, of the sort called
<i>Fornyrdalag</i> or <i>Starkadarlag</i>;" its precise date assigned, and its
historic value as an authentic document admitted by Danish scholars,
is once more acknowledged to be neither more nor less than the accidental
cracks and fissures in the rock! A golden relic was, however,
discovered during the latter part of last century, of the inscription on
which no doubt can be entertained. But it differs essentially in form
from the curious rings now referred to, and, indeed, appears to be
unique. It is engraved in the Archæologia, (vol. ii. <i>Plate</i> III. fig. 4,)
and consists of a round bar of pure and very soft and pliable gold,
gradually thickening at both ends, which are bent. On the one end
is engraved <span class="smcap">HELENVS F.</span>, and on the other, in dotted characters, the
letters <span class="smcap">M. B.</span> It was found about eighteen inches under ground in a
moss, on the estate of Mr. Irvine of Cove, near Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire.
The author of the communication in which this is noted, adds,
that "several of the same sort have been occasionally found in Scotland,
but whether with the same impresses is not mentioned." An
observation, however, of this indefinite character, can, at most, be
received only in further proof of the well-known fact, that numerous
gold relics have been discovered in Scotland from time to time,
though most frequently described in terms sufficiently vague and obscure.
The <i>Dilated Penannular Rings</i> (as I would propose, for the
sake of convenience, to call this class of relics) found at Alloa, were
discovered, along with two cinerary urns, on the top of a stone cist of
the usual circumscribed proportions,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> in which lay an entire skeleton,
of great size, and therefore, it may be presumed, a male. They were
accordingly designated by their discoverers Coffin-handles! Other
cists, and, in all, twenty-two cinerary urns, some of them of very large
size and highly decorated, were found in the same neighbourhood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>chiefly on the line of the old road from Stirling to Queensferry, where
it skirts along the base of Mar's Hill. Another such group of cists
has been discovered near the point of Largiebeg, on the south-east
coast of the Island of Arran; and in one of them, says the parish
minister, writing in 1840, in a cist which a labourer discovered a few
years ago, in making a fence round his garden, "there was found a
piece of gold in the form of a <i>handle of a drawer</i>, with some iron or
steel, much corroded, at each end. The man concealed his prize till
he got it disposed of to a jeweller in Glasgow, who melted it down
into rings and brooches."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> It would not be difficult to multiply
examples, derived from similar sources, of the ignorant and wilful
destruction of such relics of primitive native art and skill; but it
could answer little other purpose than to excite in every intelligent
reader lively but unavailing regrets.</p>

<p>Somewhat analogous to the dilated penannular rings are another
class of gold ornaments, which, so far as I am aware, have never yet
been discovered except in the British Isles. They consist of a solid
cylindrical gold bar, bent into a semicircle or segmental arc, most
frequently tapering from the centre, and terminated at both ends
with hollow cups, resembling the mouth of a trumpet, or the expanded
calix of a flower. One remarkable example of these curious native
relics, which is engraved in the Archæological Journal, presents the
characteristics of an intermediate type between the simpler forms of
the relics last described, and these <i>Calicinated Rings</i>.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> The cups
are formed merely by hollows in the slightly dilated ends; but it is
further interesting from being decorated with the style of incised
ornaments of most frequent occurrence on the primitive British
pottery. It was dug up at Brahalish, near Bantry, county Cork, and
weighs 3 oz. 5 dwts. 6 grs. In contrast to this, another is engraved
in the same Journal, found near the entrance lodge at Swinton Park,
Yorkshire, scarcely two feet below the surface. In this beautiful
specimen the terminal cups are so unusually large, that the solid
bar of gold dwindles into a mere connecting link between them. The
annexed figure of a very fine example found by a labourer while cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>peats in the parish of Cromdale, Inverness-shire, somewhat resembles
that of Swinton Park in the size of its cups. It is from a drawing
by the late Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, and represents it about two-thirds
the size of the original.
Similar relics of
more ordinary proportions
have been brought to light,
at different times, in various
Scottish districts. One
found in an urn in the north
of Scotland, in the year
1731, is described in a letter
from Sir John Clerk to Mr.
Gale, written shortly after
its discovery; and is further
illustrated in the Reliquiæ
Galeanæ, by an engraved
figure the size of the original.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Shortly afterwards, Sir John Clerk
writes to his correspondent announcing the discovery of several valuable
gold relics, including two other calicinated rings, brought to light in
consequence of the partial draining of a loch on an estate belonging to
the Earl of Stair. "I begin to think," exclaims the astonished antiquary,
"that there are treasures of all kinds in Britain; for lately in
a loch in Galloway there have been found three very curious pieces of
gold: one a bracelet, consisting of two circles, very artificially folding
or twisting into one another; now in the hands of the Countess of
Stair." The other relics are described as corresponding to an example
of the calicinated ring found in Galway, and engraved in the Archæologia.
(Vol. ii. <i>Plate</i> III. fig. 1.) One of these must have been an
unusually massive and valuable example, as its weight is stated to have
been 15 oz. Another smaller one found along with it, and weighing
only 1 oz. 4 dwts., more nearly approaches to the type of the dilated
penannular ring, the cup or bulb being covered with a flat oval plate
of gold. A bronze relic, of the latter shape, formerly in the collection
of Dr. Samuel Hibbert, is now in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.
Bronze calicinated rings have occasionally, though very
rarely, been found in Ireland. The only example I know of is in the
collection of Councillor Waller of Dublin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p>The most recent discovery in Scotland of gold relics of this singular
type, was made in the year 1838, on the estate of the late Walter
Campbell, Esq. of Sunderland, on the Island of Islay, Argyleshire.
At the period referred to, a large standing stone, which had long
been overthrown, and lay prostrate at a little distance from Sunderland
House, was blasted with gunpowder, and removed, in the process
of levelling and draining the ground for agricultural purposes. The
soil immediately underneath the stone consisted of a rich black
mould, in which were found a broad fluted gold armilla, and a fine
specimen of the calicinated ring, both lying alongside of a stone cist,
within which were several rude cinerary urns. The armilla was of a
peculiar type, being a broad band of gold beaten out so as to form a
convex centre, on each side of which was a fluted ornamental border,
and a raised rim returned at the edge. Unfortunately, this interesting
relic was carried off by a dishonest servant, but through the
kindness of Mrs. Campbell,
I am able to give the annexed
representation (about
one-fourth the size of the
original) of the calicinated
ring, which is now in
that lady's possession. Mrs.
Campbell remarks, in a
letter with which I have
been favoured,&mdash;"The bracelet was large enough to encircle a woman's
arm above the elbow. Of many specimens which I examined at the
British Museum, chiefly Irish, there was none like mine, which makes
me the more regret its loss." Various tumuli exist in the neighbourhood
of Sunderland House, several of which have been opened, and
found to cover cists of the usual limited size, none of them exceeding
three feet in greatest internal dimensions. In some of them were
found cinerary urns, while others contained the entire skeleton.</p>

<p>Some antiquaries have sought to assign a sacred significance to
these singular relics, and to associate them with the mysterious rites
of Druidical worship. Vallancey, in particular, supposes them to have
been sacrificial pateræ. There is fully as much probability, however,
in the simple conjecture that they served as clasps or fastenings for
the mantle. The cups, which appear to possess such a mystic significance,
were not probably left void in their original state. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
example first referred to, in the Reliquiæ Galeanæ, Sir John Clerk
remarks,&mdash;"The parts at the extremities are hollow, like little cups or
sockets, and the sides are very thin. There is a small circle within
the verge, which has had a red substance adhering to it like cement,
as if it had served to fix some kind of body within the sockets." A
similar appearance is still more markedly observable in an example
in the possession of Thomas Brown, Esq. of Lanfine, Ayrshire. Upon
showing it to an experienced jeweller, he assured me it cannot admit
of a doubt that the sockets have originally contained pebbles or jewels.
If it be indeed the case that in this curious gold relic we have the clasp
of the ancient British chlamys, worn by the native chief or by the arch-priest
when robed in his most stately pontificals, then we see in it a
British personal ornament which may stand comparison with the most
costly and elegant Roman fibulæ, while its essential dissimilarity from
every known classic type adds to the probability of its belonging to
an earlier era than the Anglo-Roman period.</p>

<p>Of the commoner British gold ornaments, the torc and armilla, numerous
examples have been discovered, though of these the few which
have escaped destruction are mostly in private hands, and not very
readily accessible. Three beautiful gold torcs, found at Cairnmure,
Peeblesshire, in 1806, are figured in the Archæologia Scotica.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> They
were found, along with various other relics, by a herd-boy, who going
early in the morning to his sheep, observed something glitter in
the sun, and on scraping with his feet,
brought the whole valuable treasure to
light. It consisted of three gold torcs
or collars for the neck; the beautiful
gold ornament, supposed to have been
the head of a staff or sceptre, engraved
here about one-half the size of the original;
and a number of flattened circular
gold pellets, each marked with a
cross in relief. The value of the articles
discovered in mere bullion exceeded &pound;100,
and it is doubtful if the treasure-finder
did not privately dispose of more before his good fortune was known.
The staff-head and two of the gold beads or pellets are now in the
Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries. The latter are elsewhere referred
to, along with other examples, as the primitive type of native
minted currency. The defined character, however, of the ornamentation
on the sceptre-head adds, along with the presence of these indications
of increasing civilisation, to the probability that this valuable
hoard belongs to the later transition-period, in which the age of bronze
drew to a close. Simple indeed as is the usual style of ornament and
workmanship of the funicular torc, it appears to have been retained
in use for a very long period, and is reproduced in silver and bronze
along with the latest relics of the succeeding iron age. The annexed
woodcut represents a remarkably fine example, greatly reduced, of
what may be designated the knotted funicular torc. It was found
about sixty years ago by a labourer
trenching within the area
of a circular camp on the summit
of a hill in the parish of Penicuick,
Mid-Lothian, known by the
name of Braidwood Castle. It
was of gold, and met with the
usual fate of relics of the precious
metals, having been sold by the
discoverer to a jeweller in Edinburgh
for the sum of twenty-eight
guineas, as a Roman girdle of <i>brass</i>. It was doubtless worth a much
larger sum as mere bullion. A drawing of it, however, had been
taken, it is not now apparent by whom, and is preserved in the
Library of the Scottish Antiquaries.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The history indeed of Scottish
gold relics is only a sad commentary on the miserable fruits resulting
chiefly from the operation of the law of treasure-trove. A short way
to the east of Chesterlees Station, in the parish of Dolphinton, Lanarkshire,
an ornament of pure gold was found, which is said to have
resembled the snaffle-bit of a horse's bridle.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> As this is usually a
twisted iron rod, there can be little doubt that the Chesterlees relic
was a funicular torc. A "gold chain" ploughed up on the glebe
lands of Mortlach parish, Banffshire, and described in the Old Statistical
Account of the parish, as "like an ornament for the neck of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>of the chiefs;" and another "golden chain" found at Thrumster, in
the parish of Wick, Caithness, "which in a year of famine the discoverer
sold to a bailie in Wick for a boll of oatmeal," may both be
assumed, with little hesitation, to have been golden torcs. The term,
indeed, has been used by experienced antiquaries. Gale describes a
torc found near Old Verulam in 1748, as "a wreathed or vermicular
ornament, being a solid chain of gold." One example, however, is on
record of a gold linked chain found in an early Scottish sepulchral
deposit. Nearly a mile to the east of Newton of Tillicairn, Aberdeenshire,
on the top of a ridge on which are several cairns, there is one of
unusually large size, appropriately designated Cairnmore. In 1818
this was partially opened to obtain a supply of stones for building
materials, when a quantity of bones were found, among which lay "a
small gold chain of four links, attached to a pin of such size as might
have been used in a brooch for fastening the Celtic plaid."<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> A relic
found towards the close of last century on the farm of Balmae, Kirkcudbrightshire,
and sold by the discoverer for about &pound;20, may also
be classed among the lost examples of Scottish gold torcs. It is
described as "a straight plate of gold, which was somewhat thick at
each end and at the middle. It bent easily at the centre, so as to
admit the two extremities to meet."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> It must either have been a
solid torc, or an unusually large dilated penannular ring. Amongst
the native personal ornaments in the Scottish Museum, is a massive
but plain penannular ring of the class to which the name of solid
torc is now applied. It appears to be composed of nearly pure copper,
and weighs twenty-five and a quarter ounces. It is rudely finished,
retaining the rough marks of the hammer.</p>

<p>No less beautiful than the finest examples of gold torcs are the
numerous armillæ which have been found in Scotland. Two funicular
bracelets, discovered apparently on draining the same lake in
Galloway previously referred to, are described and engraved in the
Reliquiæ Galeanæ. Sir John Clerk, writing from Edinburgh in 1732,
remarks,&mdash;"Since my last to you I have seen two other bracelets and
a large ring, found on the draining of a lake or part of it. There are
no letters or inscription, and the make is very clumsy. Each bracelet
is in weight six or seven guineas, and their shape thus,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> of two pieces
of gold twisted. The ring is large, and about a guinea in weight."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>Another example found about forty years ago in Argyleshire was sold
for a trifle to a Glasgow goldsmith, and consigned to the crucible.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
In 1834, some workmen quarrying stones near the bridge over Douglas
Water, Carmichael, Lanarkshire, discovered a pair of armillæ weighing
twenty-nine sovereigns, which were destined to the same fate;
but fortunately the Marquess of Douglas learned of the discovery
in time to repurchase them ere they had been converted into modern
trinkets, and they are now safe in that nobleman's possession. Mr.
Albert Way illustrates his communication to the Archæological Journal,
"On Ancient Armillæ of Gold," &amp;c., with an engraving of one of
a very beautiful pair, found in 1848 on the estate of Mr. Dundas of
Arniston, at Largo, in Fifeshire, of the same type as those previously
discovered in the Loch of Galloway. Mr. Way remarks of them,&mdash;"These
beautiful ornaments are formed of a thin plate or riband of
gold, skilfully twisted, the spiral line being preserved with singular
precision. It would be easy to multiply examples of torc ornaments
more or less similar in type found in this country, and especially in
Ireland; but none that I have seen possess an equal degree of elegance
and perfection of workmanship."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Mr. Dundas furnishes the
following interesting note in relation to the discovery:&mdash;"The gold
bracelets were found last winter on the top of a steep bank which
slopes down to the sea, among some loose earth which was being dug
to be carted away. The soil is sandy, and the men had dug about
three feet, where the bracelets lay. It was at a place close to the
sea-shore, called the Temple, which is part of the village of Lower
Largo. An old woman who has lived close to the spot all her days,
says that in her youth some coffins were found there, and one man
was supposed to have found a treasure, having suddenly become rich
enough to build a house." The neighbourhood of Largo Bay is celebrated
in the annals of Scottish Archæology for one of the most remarkable
hoards ever discovered, described in a later chapter as the
"silver armour of Norrie's Law." Only a very small portion of this
collection was rescued from the crucible; and the moiety of the
Largo Bay relics which escaped the same fate appears to have been
even less, if we may credit the extremely probable tradition of the
locality. With the wonted perverse modesty of Scottish antiquaries,
Mr. Dundas accompanies his account of the latter discovery with a
reference to the advantages of the neighbouring bay as a safe anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>age,
and the probability of its having been a favourite landing-place
of the northern freebooters. How strange is it, that rather than believe
in the possibility of the existence of early native art, this improbable
theory should have been fostered and bandied about by
intelligent writers without contradiction for upwards of a century.
If there were no native arts and costly treasures, what, it may be
asked, brought northern freebooters to our shores? Surely some less
extravagant hypothesis may be suggested than that they crossed the
ocean to bury their own golden treasures in our sands. It would
seem, on the contrary, to afford undoubted evidence of a tumulus or
sepulchral chamber being the work of natives or of resident colonists
when it is found to contain objects of value. Only the confidence inspired
by the universal recognition of the sacredness of such deposits
could induce the abandonment of them under cover only of a few feet
of soil. It was not until a very late period&mdash;towards the end of the
ninth century&mdash;that the northmen established a footing even on the
remoter Scottish islands; while their possession of any but a very
small portion of the mainland in the immediate vicinity of their
Orkney possessions was so brief and precarious, that it might well excite
our surprise to discover any traces of their presence on the shores
of the Forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>A variety of independent proofs, some of which have already been
referred to, amply justify the archæologist in assigning the relics of
the Archaic Period of British art to an era long prior to that of the
Scandinavian Vikings. But there is not wanting evidence to shew that
at the latter period also golden armillæ and other native personal ornaments
were common in Scotland, and, indeed, frequently furnished
the chief attractions not only to the piratical Vikings who first infested
our shores, but to the more civilized northmen who supplanted them,
and established trading colonies in the northern and western isles.
Though the full consideration of the influence of Scandinavian aggression
on early Scottish history belongs to a subsequent section, it will
not be out of place to glance at some of these proofs here, tending as
they do to shew that there is in reality greater probability in favour of
some of the gold relics found in Denmark and Norway being of British
origin, than that our native relics should be ascribed to a Scandinavian
source.</p>

<p>Snorro tells us of two thanes from <i>Fiord-riki</i>, or the kingdom of
the bay, as the southern coast of Fife was called, who, dreading the
descent of Olave of Norway on their shores, put themselves under the
protection of Canute. Snorro's account is literally,&mdash;"To Canute
came two kings from Scotland in the north, from Fife; and he gave
them up his, and all that land which they had before, and therewith
received store of winning gifts, (<i>vingiafir</i>.) This quoth Sigvatr&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>Ringa eldingham</i>, or bright rings, are frequently mentioned among
the spoils of the Norse rovers; but it is not always easy to tell
whether they refer to ornamental rings and bracelets, or to tribute
paid with ring-money. In the Norwegian account of Haco's cele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>brated
expedition against Scotland, A.D. 1263, frequent allusions
occur to such golden spoils, and especially in the extracts from the
"Raven's Ode," a song of Sturla, the Scandinavian bard, whose
nephew, Sigvat Bodvarson, attended Haco in this expedition, and
most probably supplied to Sturla materials for the narrative of his
poem. The Scottish foes are described as terrified by "the steel-clad
exactor of rings;" and Haco's reduction of the island of Bute is thus
celebrated:&mdash;"The wide-extended Bute was won from the forlorn
wearers of rings by the renowned and invincible hosts of the promoter
of conquest. They wielded the two-edged sword; the foes of
our Ruler fell, and the raven, from his field of slaughter, winged his
flight for the Hebrides."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> We find also, in the same poem, Haco
restoring the island of Ila to Angus on similar terms to those by
which the favour of Canute was purchased:&mdash;"Our sovereign, sage in
council, the imposer of tribute and brandisher of the keen falchion,
directed his long galleys through the Hebrides. He bestowed Ila,
taken by his warriors, on the valiant Angus, the distributor of the
beauteous ornaments of the hand," <i>i.e.</i>, rings or bracelets. Here then
we find the northern bard scornfully designating the Scottish foemen
as "the forlorn wearers of rings," and their tributary chiefs as the
"distributors of the beauteous bracelets." It is by the same name
claimed by the Scandinavian poet, "exactors of rings," that the early
Irish bards describe the northern warriors who infested their coasts
from the ninth to the eleventh centuries; while older allusions abundantly
prove their familiarity with the "rings" long before the
first descent of the Vikings on their shores. An interesting passage
illustrates this in an ancient MS. of the Brehon Laws, preserved
in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. The reference is to the
wife of Nuada Neacht, King of Leinster, in the first century:&mdash;"The
Righ of the wife of Nuada, she was used to have her hand (or arm)
covered with rings of gold for bestowing them on poets."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It is
abundantly manifest, therefore, that native artists had learned at a
very early period to fabricate the golden armilla, so that the theory of
Danish, or of any other foreign origin for these ancient relics, may at
once and for ever be dismissed as equally unnecessary and untenable.</p>

</div>

<p>Returning from this digression, which more properly belongs to the
succeeding section, I am fortunately able, through the kind services
of Sir James Ramsay, Bart. of Banff, to present an engraving of
another gold armilla, of the same type as those discovered at Largo,
in Fifeshire, but found alike remote from any convenient anchorage,
or from any known Norwegian settlement on the Scottish shores.
It is now the property of Lady
Menzies, and though inferior in
point of workmanship to those
found at Largo, is an exceedingly
tasteful example of primitive skill.
The original bears obvious traces
of the rough marks of the hammer,
though they interfere very
little with the beautiful reflected
lights which its elegant spirals
produce. It was found in the
north-west of Perthshire, in what
is described in Chambers' Gazetteer
as "the black wilderness
called the Moor of Rannoch; a level tract of country sixteen or
twenty miles long, and nearly as many broad, bounded by distant
mountains; an open, silent, and solitary scene of desolation; an
ocean of blackness and bogs, with a few pools of water, and a long
dreary lake." Yet how many such evidences may it contain of an
era when the Scottish bogs were luxuriant forests, and such relics
were the personal ornaments of the hunters that pursued the chase
through their sylvan glades, or of the maidens and matrons that
awaited their return! The Rannoch armilla is of sufficient size to
encircle a lady's arm; and though exhibiting unmistakable traces of
the imperfectly developed art and mechanical skill of the Archaic
Period, its beauty is sufficient, in the estimation of its present noble
owner, to induce her frequently to wear it along with the more elaborate
productions of the modern jeweller's skill. A still more beautiful
armilla, of a different type, and manifestly belonging to a later
and more perfectly developed era of art, was discovered in 1846, at
Slateford, about three miles west from Edinburgh, during the progress
of the works required in constructing the Caledonian Railway. The
labourer who found it decamped immediately with his prize. It was
shewn by him to the Treasurer of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,
but while negotiations were pending for its purchase, the discoverer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
took fright under the apprehension of having his spoil reclaimed,
and before the clue could be recovered, it was consigned to the
melting-pot. It was justly described by the distinguished Danish
antiquary, Mr. Worsaae, who saw it during his visit to Scotland, as a
relic that would have adorned any museum
in Europe. Its loss affords another
painful evidence of the necessity for some
modification of the Scottish law of treasure-trove,
as well as for a comprehensive
system for the preservation of primitive
works of native art. Fortunately a fac-simile
was made of it previous to its destruction,
and is now preserved in the
Scottish Museum. Torcs of a similar
type, terminating in solid cylindrical
ends, are described by Mr. Birch as not uncommon, and are referred
to a late period, possibly the fourth or fifth century.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Unfortunately
no account could be obtained of the circumstances under which the
Slateford Armilla was discovered. One nearly similar, found in
Cheshire, and now in the possession of Sir Philip de Grey Egerton, is
engraved in Dr. Smith's "Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,"
with other so-called Roman relics of unquestionable native origin.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 430px;">

<p>The bronze armillæ clearly assignable to the Archaic Period are
mostly of a very simple character, consisting either of solid or penannular
rings, or more rarely of a thin spiral band of the metal. They
are much rarer, however, in any form than those of gold. The following
account of the discovery of bracelets <i>in situ</i>, in the parish of Glenholm,
Peeblesshire, is possessed of peculiar interest, though we have
to regret, as in so many other instances, the absence of more precise
information. "There is a plain by the side of Tweed on which
there are several mounts, apparently artificial. The proprietor had
the curiosity to cause one of them to be digged, and there found the
skeleton of a man, with bracelets on his arms. The body was inclosed
in a stone building, with a stone cover, and nigh him was an urn."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
In another grave opened at Westray in Orkney, a gold ring was found
encircling one of the thigh-bones of the skeleton.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Similar examples
are familiar to Scandinavian antiquaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>The torc as well as the funicular armilla and other relics of corresponding
type, though known to the Romans, were regarded by them
as barbarian decorations. Like so many others of the characteristic
peculiarities of the Celtæ, they are clearly traceable to an Eastern
origin. The torc is introduced at Persepolis among the tribute
brought to Darius; and in the mosaic of Pompeii, Darius and his officers
are represented wearing it at the battle of Arbela.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Titus Manlius
Torquatus took the golden torc from whence he derived his name from
a Gaul he slew in single combat B.C. 361: and its first appearance
in Italian art is round the neck of the moustached Gaulish hero,
whose head forms the obverse of the As of Arminium, decorated probably
according to the fashion of his country, four centuries before
the Christian era. Still more interesting is its occurrence on the neck
of the dying gladiator, the masterpiece of Ctesilaus. In this historic
example of the torc, it is funicular with bulbous terminations, resembling
one seen on the Sarcophagus of the Vigna Amendola, representing,
as is believed, the exploits of the Romans over the Gauls or
Britons. So far then from the torc being either Romish or Danish,
it may be regarded as the most characteristic relic of primitive Celtic
and Teutonic art, brought with the British Celtæ from the East centuries
before the era of Rome's foundation, and familiar only to the
Roman as one of the barbaric spoils which adorned the procession of
a triumphant general, or marked the foreign captive that he dragged
in his reluctant train.</p>

<p>In addition to torcs, armlets, and other ornaments for the neck
and arms, metal rings of various kinds have been found in Scotland
as in other countries, to which, though apparently designed for personal
ornament, it is more difficult to assign an exact purpose. Several
of these will fall to be described in the following section, as from their
well defined characteristics more probably pertaining to the latest
Pagan era; but others completely agree in their archaic style and
workmanship with undoubted relics of the Bronze Period. To this
class belong various bronze rings, generally with broad expanded ends
overlapping each other, corresponding to a well-known class of continental
antiquities, which the northern archæologists believe to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
been worn about the head and entwined with the hair. Two of these,
of very rude workmanship, now in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
were found a few years since about 300 yards from a large
cairn, in the parish of Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire, which popular
local tradition affirms to mark the spot where Macbeth fell by the
hand of the Thane of Fife. One of these is figured here on a small
scale. Its dimensions, however, are abundantly sufficient to admit of its
encircling the head, and both ends terminate in broad flattened plates,
probably designed to rest on the forehead.
Similar features occur in those of a later
date and much more ornamental character,
some of which are referred to in
a future chapter. With this class also
may be noted, among the relics belonging
to the period in the same collection, an
annulus of bronze, hollowed on the under
side, measuring two and three-fourths inches in greatest diameter;
and several bronze rings of various sizes, the largest three and a quarter
inches in diameter, found in an urn in the parish of Kinneff, Kincardineshire.</p>

<p>Smaller personal ornaments were also made of bronze, and occur
among the works of a later period frequently characterized by great
beauty of form and delicacy of ornament. The woodcut represents
a bronze ring-fibula, of simple but
somewhat peculiar design, and a
spiral bronze ring, both the size of
the originals. They were found
about nine years since, during the
construction of a new road leading
from Granton Pier to Edinburgh, in
a small stone cist, distant only about
twenty yards from the sea-shore.
It contained two skeletons, which from the position of the bones and
the square and circumscribed form of the cist, appeared to have
been interred in a sitting posture. Mr. C. R. Smith has figured a
bronze fibula of the same type, though of ruder workmanship, among
the numerous relics pertaining to various periods found at Richborough
in Kent.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Several examples of the spiral finger-ring have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>been found in Britain with remains of different periods. They are also
known to northern antiquaries among the older relics of Denmark
and Sweden. This may indeed be regarded as one of the earliest
forms of the ring, since it is only at a comparatively late period
that we discover any traces of a knowledge of the art of soldering
among the native metallurgists. A silver ring of the same early
type, formed one of the personal ornaments in the celebrated Norrie's
Law hoard, found on the opposite shores of the Frith of Forth.</p>

<p>Hair-pins and bodkins are another class of relics contained in the
tombs of this period, generally of bronze, though they have occasionally
been met with, and especially in Ireland, both of gold and silver,
and richly set with jewels. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharp, Esq., has in
his possession three magnificent ornaments of the latter class, formerly
in the collection of Major Surr, such as might rival the most costly
and elaborate works of the modern jeweller. Among the rarest and
most curious forms of the bronze pin is that with a head hollowed like
a cup; one of which has already been referred to, found along with a
variety of other bronze relics, in a bog in the Isle of Skye, and now
in the possession of Lord Macdonald. It exactly corresponds to an
Irish example engraved in the Archæological Journal. Others have
the head decorated with a variety of grooves and mouldings, and
occasionally perforated, as if for attaching to them some pendulous
ornament. Perforated bronze implements are likewise found, which
it can hardly be doubted were used as needles; and among the rare
and most perishable contents of the tumuli have occasionally been
recovered small fragments of knitted or woven tissues, the productions
of the primitive weaver whose bones crumble into dust on being
exposed, and almost literally vanish before our eyes. Douglas engraves
in the Nenia some interesting fragments of such ancient manufactures,
of the herring-bone pattern, found on opening some tumuli
in Greenwich Park. But by far the most perfect specimen I have
ever seen was procured by Dr. Samuel Hibbert, about the year 1838,
from some labourers who had found it on the chance exposure of a
stone cist, while excavating for railway work, near Micklegate Bar,
York. This valuable relic is now in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries. It appears to be a sleeve, or the covering for the leg,
and somewhat resembles the hose worn by the south-country Scottish
farmers, drawn over their ordinary dress as part of their riding gear.
It has been knitted, a process which doubtless preceded the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
weaving, probably by many centuries. The fabric is still strong, and,
in careful keeping, may long suffice to illustrate the domestic manufactures
of the ancient Briton. This is one of the examples to which
reference has been made in a former chapter, as shewing the source
to which it is conceived some of the ornamental designs on the early
British pottery are traceable; though the resemblance is less striking
here than in some more imperfect specimens of such products of the
primitive knitting needle or loom. The accompanying woodcut, representing
a portion of the knitted fabric, will enable the reader
who is familiar with the style of ornamentation on the pottery of the
tumuli, to judge for himself how far this idea is justified by the correspondence
traceable between them.</p>

<p>In 1786 a much more complete specimen was found, seventeen
feet below the surface of an Irish bog in the county of Longford. It
is described by Mr. Richard Lovell Edgeworth,
in a Report to the Commissioners
for improving the bogs in Ireland, as "a
woollen coat of coarse but even net-work,
exactly in the form of what is now called
a spencer." Iron arrow-heads, large
wooden bowls, some only half made, with
what were supposed to be the remains of
turning tools, lay alongside of it. The
coat was presented by Mr. Edgeworth to
the Society of Antiquaries, but is no longer
known to exist. Possibly it rapidly decayed,
as all such relies must be apt to
do on exposure to the air; or perchance
its history was lost sight of, in which case
its value would appear very slight in
the estimation of the ordinary class of
curators.</p>

<p>In 1822 Professor Stuart of Aberdeen communicated to the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland an interesting account of the opening of a
tumulus at Fetteresso, Kincardineshire.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Within it was found a stone
cist about four feet in length, containing a skeleton, with the legs so
bent back that the knees almost touched the lower end of the cist.
The bottom was strewed with round sea pebbles from the neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>ing
beach. Above this appeared some vegetable substance, in which
the body had been imbedded, and over that, covering the whole, a
tissue of wrought net-work, beautifully executed, but which, along
with all the other contents, crumbled to dust soon after being exposed
to the air. A great number of small black balls were found surrounding
the body, plainly vegetable, and described as closely resembling
acorns. At the top of the cist there seemed to have been placed a
fresh sod or turf, which still retained the impression of the head that
had been pillowed on it ages before, though no parts of the skull, nor
even any of the teeth, were found. Some of the hair, however, four
or five inches long, and of an auburn colour, still remained, and over
the breast were seen the remains of a small box of an oval shape,
apparently of wood elegantly carved; but this also speedily crumbled
to powder. In the month of November 1847, another cist was discovered
about an hundred yards to the south of the Fetteresso tumulus,
which may with much probability be assumed as a female grave; and
if so, adds another to the examples already noted of the occurrence
of the Scottish sepulchral urn accompanying female remains. The
cist measured only three feet in length, by two feet in breadth, and
contained a human skeleton which appeared to have been laid on the
right side with the face to the south. The limbs were bent according
to the usual disposition of the body in the circumscribed cist, and one
of the leg bones seemed to have been broken. A rude urn, about six
inches deep, lay as if it had been folded in the arms of the deceased,
and upwards of a hundred jet beads, which had no doubt formed a
necklace, were found beside the breast.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

SEPULCHRES.</h3>


<p>The tombs of the Bronze Period appear to differ, in various important
respects, from those which are clearly assignable to the Primeval
Period. Some of their peculiar features have already been noticed,
in describing the circumstances under which sepulchral pottery and
their relics have been met with; but others equally characteristic of
the first era of development and progress remain to be described.
To this epoch, as has been already observed, it seems probable that
we must assign the introduction of the practice of cremation, while
the huge cromlechs and chambered barrows and cairns, appear to
have been abandoned along with the simpler rites of primitive inhumation,
for the smaller cist and cinerary urn. To this period also
we can have little hesitation in ascribing the earliest attempts at
sculpture or inscription which are met with on primitive sepulchral
memorials. The two most remarkable examples of sculptured monolithic
structures hitherto explored are the celebrated chambered cairn
of Newgrange, in the county of Meath, and that on the small island
of Gavr' Innis in Brittany. These gigantic and complicated works
appear indeed to pertain to the transition between the Primeval and
Archaic Periods, and partake at once of the earliest cyclopean characteristics
and the later ornamental decorations.</p>

<p>An abridged extract of the account furnished by Mr. J. W. Lukis of
the remarkable structure of Gavr' Innis will best illustrate the peculiar
features of such decorated sepulchral chambers. Gavr' Innis is a
small island, about a quarter of a mile in length, situated in the department
du Morbihan, Brittany. It is elevated somewhat above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
neighbouring islands, and with its tumulus, which still covers the
cromlech, forms one of the most conspicuous objects of the inland
Archipelago. The tumulus is about thirty feet high, and three
hundred feet in circumference. The cromlech beneath forms a large
central chamber, with a passage, constructed like it of huge masses
of granite, leading out to the south side of the mound.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Being furnished," says Mr. Lukis, "with candles, I entered the cromlech Gavr'
Innis by a small opening at the south end, which is between three and four feet
wide, by about the same in height. Having reached the third and fourth props,
my attention was at once arrested by finding them covered with engraved lines,
forming patterns resembling the tattooing of the New Zealander. On proceeding
farther into the interior the height increased, rendering the passage to the end
more easy; and I found nearly the whole of the props covered with similarly
engraved lines. Here there is much to excite admiration at the regularity and
beauty of so extraordinary a place; and on turning to a prop on the western side,
the imagination is farther exercised to perceive the purpose or use of three circular
holes, sunk into the face of the stone, each about six inches deep, and the same
in diameter: they communicate with each other, and form a sort of trough within
the stone. It is divided in front by two raised parts resembling in form the handles
to a jar."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>Other cromlechs in Brittany are similarly decorated; and Mr. Lukis
arrives at the conclusion that in some of them the stones must have
been engraved prior to their erection, from the ornaments extending
round the sides which are now covered by adjoining stones. The
sculptured decorations at Newgrange are no less remarkable, and the
same observation has been made in regard to them, that the carvings
must have been executed before the stones upon which they appear
had been placed in their present positions. We shall not probably err<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
in assigning as contemporaneous works with these rare and most primitive
examples of sculptured sepulchral chambers, the rude cists occasionally
found decorated with similar devices, though otherwise
entirely unhewn. The annexed view of one of these incised slabs is
engraved from a drawing presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh
by Colonel Hugh Montgomery of Shielmorly, in 1785, and subsequently
transferred to the Society of Antiquaries. It formed the
cover of a cist, discovered in digging a gravel-pit at Coilsfield, in
Ayrshire, and underneath it was found an urn filled with incinerated
bones. The dimensions of the stone were about five feet in length
by two and a half feet in breadth. The original drawing includes
the representation of the portion of the urn shewn here, which it will
be seen presents only the usual characteristics of primitive sepulchral
pottery. A subsequent discovery of cinerary
urns at the same spot has been assumed
to authenticate one of the many
dubious incidents recorded by our earlier
chroniclers in relation to a no less celebrated
hero than "Old King Coil." Near
Coilsfield House is a large tumulus,
crowned with two huge blocks of granite, which local tradition affirmed
to mark the place of sepulture of the redoubted hero, of whom
Boece records,&mdash;"King Coyll, unwarly kepit be his nobilis, was slane,
in memory wherof the place quhare he was slane wes namit efter
Coyll; quhilk regioun remanis yit under the same name, or litill different
thairfra, callit now Kyle."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Certain zealous local antiquaries
having resolved to put tradition to the test, the tumulus was opened
in 1837, and found to inclose a cist covered by a circular stone about
three feet in diameter, beneath which four plain urns were disposed,
the largest of which measured nearly eight inches in height. The
author of a recent topographical work on the district of Kyle has
gravely assumed this discovery as giving "to the traditionary evidence,
and to the statements of early Scottish historians in regard to
Coil, <i>except with respect to the date</i>, a degree of probability higher
than they formerly possessed!"<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> What more might not the antiquaries
of Kyle have been able to establish had they known of the
older discovery on the same spot, and of the mysterious symbols
traced on the sepulchral stone!</p>

<p>Another cist, decorated with concentric circles in a manner nearly
similar to the Coilsfield stone, was exposed a few years since in constructing
the road which leads from South Queensferry through the
Craigiehall estate. It still remains, nearly perfect, in the high bank
on the side of the road, the end of the cist only having been removed,
and the covering slab left in its place. It contained bones and ashes,
without any urn. In Mr. J. Walker Ord's "History and Antiquities
of Cleveland," an interesting account is given of the opening of some
tumuli on Bernaldby Moor, in 1843, in one of which&mdash;a bell-shaped
barrow&mdash;was found a remarkably fine cinerary urn sixteen and a half
inches high, covered with an unhewn slab carved with rude devices
similar in style to those described above. Of the same class also is
another slab figured here, the drawing of which was made by George
Scott, the friend of Mungo Park, who accompanied him to Africa and
died there. It was forwarded to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland
by Sir Walter Scott, in 1828, who described the original as a
rough sandstone, about six feet long by perhaps two and a half broad,
which was raised by the plough at a place called Annan Street, upon
the farm of Wheathope. The drawing is designated, probably by the
original draftsman, "a Druid stone found at Annan Street, figured
with the sun and moon." Little doubt can be entertained that it had
formed the cover of a cist, though few probably will now be inclined
to attempt a solution of the enigmatic devices rudely traced on its
surface. The spot where it was found is about half a mile from the
church of Yarrow, and close by there are two large stones, about 120
yards apart, which are believed to mark the scene of the memorable
struggle that has given "The dowie houms of Yarrow" so touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
a place in the beautiful legendary poetry of Scotland. Thus does the
human mind delight to give a local habitation to the mythic and traditional
characters and incidents that take hold on the fancy, whether
it be the old mythological smith Wayland, associated with the cromlech
of Berkshire; the fabulous King Coil, and the sepulchral barrow
of Ayrshire; or The Flower of Yarrow, the creation of some nameless
Scottish minstrel, whose pathetic ballad will live as long as our language
endures.</p>

<p>The rude attempts at sculpture figured here are certainly as artless,
and to us as meaningless, as the chance traces of wind and tide on the
deserted sea-beach. Doubtless they had a meaning and an object
once, and were not produced without the expenditure both of time
and labour by the primitive artist, provided almost for the first time
with metallic tools. To us they are simply of value as probably indicating
the infantile efforts of the old British sculptor, and the rudiments
of the art to which we owe such gorgeous piles as the Cathedral
of Salisbury, and such sculptures as those of Wells and York. Even
as the parent delights to trace in the prattle of his child the promises
of future years, the archæologist may be pardoned if he is
sometimes tempted to linger too fondly on those infantile efforts of
the human race until he sees in them the germ of future arts, the
first attempts at symbolic prefigurements, and the rudiments of those
representative signs from which have sprung letters and all that followed
in their train.</p>

<p>The most interesting and characteristic features, however, which
the tombs of the Bronze Period disclose, are the weapons and implements
deposited alongside of the deceased, or inclosed with his ashes
in the cinerary urn. Much variety is traceable in the design as well
as in the mode of disposing of these enduring tokens of reverence
and affection. But we have already examined them with sufficient
minuteness, and have found a distinctive uniformity traceable throughout
the whole; marking with no doubtful features the products of an
epoch in which we discern the germ of all future progress, and the
dawn of that civilisation the full development of which we are now
privileged to enjoy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

RELIGION, ARTS, AND DOMESTIC HABITS.</h3>


<p>The title of this chapter, as of some others of those relating to
British history prior to the first century of the Christian era, may
perhaps appear to readers of indices as not a little presumptuous.
These chapters deal exclusively with a period believed to have long
preceded written history, and of which we possess no other records
than those that have been garnered in the grave, wherein is "no
knowledge," or chance-found amid the alluvium and peat-mosses, in
which the geologist discerns many evidences of antiquity, but from
which he has yet failed to deduce any defined measure that will help
us to their age. Still we have found, in the ruder productions of the
primitive period, that the simplest works of man bear some ineffaceable
traces of his intelligence. The sagacious inductions of Cuvier
have met with universal acceptation in their definition of the form,
the size, the food, and the general haunts and habits of the Megalonyx,
a gigantic antediluvian sloth, only a few disjointed bones of
which are known to exist. We need not therefore despair of learning
somewhat of the early Caledonian, of his habits, his thoughts, and
even of his faith, when we are able to refer to so many specimens of
his handiwork and inventive design, and retain some relics of his
ruined temples, and abundant illustrations of his sepulchral rites. It
is by simple induction, however, that the discovery of such truths is
aimed at. Intentionally, at least, no rein is given here to fanciful
speculation, nor are any theories advanced but such as are believed
to be based on the suggestive aspects of ascertained truths.</p>

<p>We have no reason to assume that the aboriginal Caledonian of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Bronze Period ever carried civilisation so far as materially to affect
the social character of the community. The patriarchal system of
tribes or clans, we may presume, continued nearly as we know them
to have existed at the first dawn of written history, or, at most, were
only modified by the union of a greater or less number of petty tribes
under some general chief. Many improvements on the accommodation
and conveniencies of the native hut and its furnishings would
necessarily result from the possession of metallic tools. With these
only could the art of the carpenter be developed, and the implements
of husbandry and the chase, as well as the weapons of war, be moulded
into useful and convenient forms. The clothing also, we have seen,
was aided by the ingenuity and skill of feminine arts. The skins of
the deer or the wild bull, as well as of the fox, the hare, and the
smaller fur-clad animals, would thus be superseded in part, and
fashioned, where they were retained, with such improved taste as
made them correspond to the beautiful ornaments of the period. Of
very much of this all evidence has disappeared, but enough remains
to prove that the Caledonian of the Bronze Period was no naked
painted savage. Whether the ingenious knitters of the garments, the
precious fragments of which have occasionally been rescued from the
tumuli, had learned to adorn them with any interwoven parti-colours
may be doubted; but the learned Scottish antiquary, Dr. Jamieson,
has already suggested the Gaelic <i>breac</i>, signifying parti-coloured, and
<i>breacan</i>, a tartan plaid, as perhaps the true source of derivation of
the name <i>Gallia Braccata</i>, which would thus refer to the colour rather
than to the fashion of the Celtic dress. We know certainly, from the
sculptures on Trajan's column, that the <i>Bracæ</i> were not so unfamiliar
to the Romans as to be adopted as the peculiar characteristic of a
single race. It is to be borne in remembrance, however, that in so far
as this archæological period is strictly defined to include only the era
of Archaic art, and the working in gold, copper, and bronze, prior to
the knowledge or economic use of iron, it must be assigned to an epoch
which had drawn to a close before the Britons were known to the
Romans, unless by vague traditions indirectly acquired through Carthage
or Spain, or by the imperfect notices of the Cassiterides to be
found in the pages of early Greek writers.</p>

<p>An interesting inquiry suggests itself in relation to this as to all
unknown states of society&mdash;What was the social position of woman?
To this the answer we can at present give is very uncertain. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
traces already noted are not such as to discourage all hope of attaining
to greater definiteness and certainty. The frequent occurrence
of what appear to be female personal ornaments among the
contents of the Scottish tumuli, seems to afford satisfactory indications
that woman possessed, at that early era, somewhat of the equality
of social position which still peculiarly characterizes the races of
Northern Europe. Further investigations can hardly fail to add more
certainty to our deductions, while they may also greatly enlarge the
evidence on which they are based. For the rest, we infer with more
certainty that the dog was the chosen companion of man in these
old days, as he is still; for the bones of the buried favourite have
been frequently found laid beside his master's urn. Doubtless his
value in the chase was well known, and his fidelity fully recognised
at the hearth. Whether the horse had also become, thus early, man's
useful companion and servant, appears still open to further inquiry.
Probably not till the succeeding era had fairly brought its civilizing
influences into full operation, did the Briton establish his dominion
over the noble and intelligent quadruped which assumed so important
a place in the symbolism and mythology of his latest Pagan creed;
though the investigations of the geologist leave no room to question
its presence prior to, if not contemporarily with the earliest colonists
of the British Isles. From diverse points, and by various means, we
thus seek to catch a glimpse of those old historic eras. But, with all
such aids, our view must be owned to be sufficiently slight, and our
outline to stand in need of much filling in, before we can picture as
we would wish to do, the intelligent Briton of that old time when he
was still, perhaps, a barbarian, but had ceased to be a savage, and is
therefore the just object of our earnest sympathy as the originator of
much the beneficent results of which we even now inherit.</p>

<p>This first era of civilisation, which succeeded the introduction of
metals and is known as the Bronze or Archaic Period, manifestly
differs, in many essential points, from that primeval period previously
considered. It is the birth-time of native arts wherein we discern
the possibility of still better things. There pertains to it an interest
altogether peculiar. Its acquired knowledge probably long exceeded
its means. Copper and bronze could at no time be so plentifully
supplied as to admit of the facilities to which the abundance and
cheapness of iron have for so many centuries accustomed us. With a
thorough knowledge of the superiority of metals, the ingenious artificer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
was compelled, throughout the whole Bronze Period, to manufacture
nearly all his bulkier implements of stone. Still he was being educated,
so that when the greater facilities did come within his reach,
he was able to avail himself of them. We must look, indeed, upon this
whole period, as upon the early years of an intelligent child&mdash;rich with
the freshness, the originality, and the unconscious simplicity of youth.
Its efforts are extremely unequal, blending the most Archaic works
with occasional productions rivalling the ingenuity and taste of the
polished eras which have succeeded. We detect, moreover, the evidences
of a social state wherein the value of combined operations
had still to be learned, and where isolation led to abundant manifestations
of ingenuity and skill, without producing any immediate
results beyond the little sphere of the native hut, or hamlet, or patriarchal
clanship. We discover, indeed, nothing inconsistent with such
a social and political state as we know to have pertained among the
most civilized British tribes in the century immediately preceding
the Christian era, when, for the first time, we are able to look upon
them with the aid of definite, though somewhat prejudiced and disparaging
narratives of classic historians. I would only add, that
there appears no shadow of evidence thus far discoverable, on which
to found a single doubt as to the indigenous character of British relics
of the Primeval and Archaic Periods. As to the favourite idea of their
Danish origin, it is altogether absurd and irreconcilable with known
facts. Nothing is more certainly established in the history of these
northern races, and, indeed, involved in the nature of things, than that,
long before the Scandinavian races emerged from the <i>viks</i> and <i>fiords</i>
of the north, the Archaic Periods both of Scandinavian and British
arts had been superseded by others more compatible with the social
status which such aggressive movements very manifestly indicate.</p>

<p>The term <i>Archaic</i> has been adopted as a definition of this era, because,
in the sense which is now most generally attached to it, it
peculiarly applies to the artistic productions of the period. The
ornamentation is almost without exception only improvements on the
accidents of manufacture. The incised decorations of the pottery
appear, in many cases, to have been produced simply by passing
twisted cords round the soft clay. More complicated designs, most
frequently consisting of chevron, saltire, or herring-bone patterns,
where they are not merely the primary results of a combination of
such lines, have been suggested, as I conceive, by the few and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>half-accidental
patterns of the industrious female knitter. In no single
case is any attempt made at the imitation of a leaf or flower, of
animals, or any other simple natural objects. It is curious, indeed,
and noteworthy, to find how entirely every trace of imitative art is
absent in the British Archaic relics, for it is by no means an invariable
characteristic of the primitive arts of Allophylian nations. The
objects recovered from the sepulchral mounds of the Great Valley of
the Mississippi, as well as in the regions of Mexico and Yucatan,
display, along with the weapons and implements of stone, silex, and
obsidian, numerous indications of imitative design. Among the relics
of the aboriginal mound-builders of the Great Valley especially, pipe-heads,
tubes, masks, and a great variety of nondescript articles, are
often characterized by evidences of very considerable ingenuity and
imitative skill. Even the pottery is occasionally moulded into the
forms of animals, and when only decorated with lines these are very
frequently arranged in such definite or flowing patterns as suggest
their derivation from flowers and other objects in nature.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> The
natives of the Polynesian Islands display a similar though perhaps
inferior taste in their clubs, paddles, and mallets, the prows of their
boats, and numerous other objects, carving them into grotesque imitations
of human and other animal forms.</p>

<p>The indefinite and Archaic character which marks the ornamentation
of the early British pottery, characterizes the most elaborate
and costly ornaments of gold. Though the peculiar form of one class
of gold ornaments found in the British Isles has suggested a name for
it derived from the calix of a flower, which the cups of its rings seem
in some degree to resemble, yet no example has been found bearing
the slightest traces of ornament suggestive of such similarity having
been detected by the old British goldsmith. Where incised lines are
superinduced upon the flower-like forms, they are the old chevron and
saltire patterns of the rude clay pottery, though executed with considerable
delicacy and taste. It is obvious that ideas of comparison,
which enter so largely into the spirit of modern artistic design, and
also form so considerable an element in the more artificial poetic
compositions of modern bards, were altogether undeveloped in these
old times. Art was, in fact, the child of necessity, and continued to
receive the adjuncts of adornment from the same sources from whence
it had first derived its convenient but arbitrary forms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 667px;">
<img src="images/image341.jpg" width="667" height="109" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Gold Rod. Circle of Leys.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The gold "sceptre head" found at Cairnmure in Peeblesshire, and
engraved on a former page, is one of the very few examples of
defined forms of ornamentation found along with objects some of which
at least may admit of being classed with those belonging to this
period. They are still arbitrary, and, strictly speaking, not imitative,
though they approach towards forms directly imitative, or at least
designed to be representative, with which we shall become familiar
in the succeeding era. Little doubt, however, can be entertained that
the sceptre head belongs to the succeeding era. The funicular torc was
undoubtedly in use in the latest Pagan period, and the whole Cairnmure
hoard may very consistently be assigned to it. The large ornaments
on the sceptre head, though very partially defined, resemble in some
degree the "snake-pattern," which forms one of the commonest decorations
of the last Pagan era. The woodcut exhibits a much more characteristic
primitive symbol of office. It is the gold lituus dug up in the
year 1824, within the monolithic circle of Leys, Inverness-shire. The
parts united together form a rod nearly eighteen inches long, the rude
workmanship of which strikingly contrasts with the delicate though
imperfectly defined ornamentation of the Cairnmure sceptre head.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
This entire absence of imitation in the primitive British arts is an
important fact in its bearing on our present inquiries, seeing that it
is not a universal or even a very general characteristic of Allophylian
nations. The relics, as we have seen, recovered from the sepulchral
mounds of the Great Valley of the Mississippi, as well as in the regions
of Mexico and Yucatan, display numerous indications of imitative skill.
The same is observable in the arts of various tribes of Africa, Polynesia,
and of other modern races in an equally primitive state. What is to
be specially noted in connexion with this is, that both in the ancient
and modern examples, the imitative arts accompany the existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>of idols, and the abundant evidences of an idolatrous worship. So
far as we yet know the converse holds true in relation to the primitive
British races, and as a marked importance is justly attached to the
contrasting creeds and modes of worship and polity of the Allophylian
and Arian nations, I venture to throw out this suggestion as not
unworthy of further consideration.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Yet we are not entirely dependent
on negative evidence in relation to the primitive creed. We
are led to the conclusion that the ancient Briton lived in the belief
of a future state, and of some doctrine of probation and of final retribution,
from the constant deposition beside the dead, not only of weapons,
implements, and personal ornaments, but also of vessels which
may be presumed to have contained food and drink. That his ideas
of a future state bore little resemblance to "the life and immortality
brought to light by the Gospel," is abundantly manifest from the
same evidence. Somewhat, however, is added to our knowledge of
his religion, if the inference be admitted to be a legitimate one which
deduces from the absence of all imitation of natural objects in his ornamental
designs, the conclusion that idolatry has pertained under no
form to the worship of the native Briton. Whether his religion was a
fetish-worship, with spells and strange magical rites; or that he brought
from his far eastern birthland the Chaldean star-worship or the Persian
fire-worship; or knelt to Sylvanus and the <i>Campestres Æterni</i>
<i>Britanniæ</i>,&mdash;the supposed haunters of his native fields and forests, to
whom the Roman legions afterwards reared altars and poured out
libations,&mdash;it seems consistent with all analogy to conclude that no
visible forms were worshipped within the Caledonian groves or monolithic
temples. Julius Cæsar, in his oft-quoted account of the Druids,
describes the Gauls as much addicted to religious observances, and
names Mars, Apollo, Jupiter, Minerva, and Mercury, as objects of their
worship. Of Mercury especially, he adds, they have many images,
and they esteem him as the inventor of the arts. This, however,
might be true enough of the continental Gauls of that late period,
who had then long been partially brought into contact with the
Romans, and yet be totally inapplicable to the Caledonians, who had
no direct knowledge of them for fully a century after the date of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>Cæsar's first landing on the white cliffs of England. As to the
theories relating to Celtic Druidism, concerning which so much has
been written, an opinion has already been expressed. It is one of the
many branches of primitive history, in which, after having perused
all the ponderous tomes which have been devoted to its elucidation,
the archæologist returns with renewed satisfaction to the trustworthy
though imperfect and scanty records which he finds in the relics of
primitive invention and archaic design. The truths contained in
these ample dissertations are mostly too few and uncertain to be
worth the labour of sifting them from the heap in which they may be
buried, at the rate of about a grain of truth to a bushel of fancy.
Still, from the authentic allusions of classic writers, we may safely
conclude thus far, that a native priesthood exercised a most important
influence over the later Celtic and Teutonic races of Britain, as appears
to have been the case among most of the nations of the Indo-European
family.</p>

<p>In the present state of archæological inquiry, it would be presumptuous
to assign dogmatically the precise races to which the arts
of each period pertain. Still the indications both of archæological
and direct historical evidence manifestly point to the Celtæ as comparatively
late intruders, and leave us to seek, with little hesitation,
in their Allophylian precursors for the metallurgists of the Archaic
Period. In the Kumbe-kephalic Allophyliæ, we may expect to trace
the rude primeval workers in stone, with undefined sepulchral rites,
and no distinct evidences of a faith or hope beyond the grave. Upon
this meanly gifted race the Brachy-kephalic Allophyliæ intruded,
bringing with them, in all probability, the knowledge of metallurgic
arts, yet effecting their aggressions by such slow degrees that, as we
have seen, their arts appear to have reached our northern regions long
before the rude aborigines were called upon to employ them in repelling
their originators. From these as well as other arguments we
infer, that when the earliest Celtic nomades first reached our coasts,
they found the older natives already in possession of weapons of bronze,
and familiar with the most essential processes of the metallurgist.
Whether the Celtæ had acquired any knowledge of iron at the period
of their arrival in Europe must have depended to a great extent on the
nature of their previous intercourse with the civilized nations of Central
Asia; but the smelting of the iron ore and the working of the metal
to any great extent, are manifestly altogether incompatible with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
condition of a nomade people, migrating across a continent the partial
clearings of which were already occupied by hostile races. Some
reference has been made in a former chapter to evidence which an
investigation of the languages of the Indo-European nations furnishes
as to the degree of progress to which they had attained at the period of
their dispersion. It would lead us to infer that they were either entirely
ignorant of the use of the metals, or had lost this useful knowledge
amid the exigencies and privations of their nomade life. In so
far, therefore, this important source of ethnological evidence involves
nothing essentially inconsistent with the idea of the metallurgic
arts being introduced in Britain for the first time among a Celtic
population already established on the soil. The earliest knowledge,
however, which we acquire of the continental Celtæ exhibits them as
skilled workers in metals, and even the Romans appear to have
acquired their principal supplies of iron and the art of converting it
into steel, from the Norici, a Celtic race who occupied a considerable
tract of country south of the Danube. Whatever was the precise state
to which this race had sunk at the period of its earliest pioneers intruding
on the Allophylian nations of Europe, the supremacy acquired
by them is sufficient evidence of their innate superiority. Possessed
originally of good mental capacity, so soon as the successive wandering
hordes of the Indo-European stock formed permanent locations,
it is to be presumed that evidences of their powers would be manifested;
but even in their nomade state they bore with them some
of the elements by which the Arian tribes are held to be distinguishable
from the older Allophylian nations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"They had bards or scalds, <i>vates</i>, &#7936;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#953;, who were supposed under a divine influence
to celebrate the history of ancient times, and connect them with revelations
of the future, and with a refined and metaphysical system of dogmas, which were
handed down from age to age, and from one tribe to another, as the primeval creed
and possession of the enlightened race. Among them, in the West as well as in
the East, the doctrine of metempsychosis held a conspicuous place, implying belief
in an after state of rewards and punishments, and a moral government of the world.
With it was connected the notion that the material universe had undergone and
was destined to undergo a repetition of catastrophes by fire and water; and after
each destruction to be renewed in fresh beauty, when a golden age was again to
commence, destined in a fated time to corruption and decay. The emanation of all
beings from the soul of the universe, and their refusion in it, which were tenets
closely connected with this system of dogmas, border on a species of Pantheism,
and are liable to all the difficulties attendant upon that doctrine.</p>

<p>"Among most of the Indo-European nations the conservation of religious dogmas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
patriarchal tradition, and national poetry, was confided not to accidental reminiscences
and popular recitations, but to a distinct order of persons, who were venerated
as mediators between the invisible powers and their fellow-mortals, as the
depositaries of sacred lore, and interpreters of the will of the gods expressed of old
to the first man, and handed down orally in divine poems, or preserved in a sacred
literature known only to the initiated. In most instances they were an hereditary
caste, Druids, Brahmans, or Magi. Among the Allophylian nations, on the other
hand, a rude and sensual superstition prevailed, which ascribed life and mysterious
powers to the inanimate objects."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p></div>

<p>The contrasting religion of fetisses and spells, ascribed to the
Allophylian nations, has already been referred to. It still exists
among the Finns and Lappes of the north of Europe, and the Vogules,
Ostiakes, and Esquimaux, occupying the northern regions of Asia
and America, whither we may naturally conclude they have been
driven by the intrusion of the superior races. To these, perhaps,
we must look for the living type of the primeval Briton, and to their
rude superstitions for some shadowy tradition of the creed by which
his untutored mind took hold of the unseen. How much of the
refined system of metaphysical dogmas ascribed by Dr. Prichard as
a general characteristic of the Arian nations, pertained to those of
them that colonized Britain, we can only partially surmise. We
know, however, that at the period when the annals of our island are
first embraced within the limits of authentic written history, a native
priesthood existed, combining not only the sacerdotal and judicial
characters, so frequently found united in the priesthood of even comparatively
civilized races, but also such influence as leaders and
chiefs that the Romans found in them their most implacable and
unrelenting foes. Hence their religious rites were early proscribed
by the imperial lieutenants; and the Druid priest, who held fast by
his mysterious faith and passionate love of national independence,
fell back before the advancing legions of Rome, till he found partial
and temporary repose within the ancient groves of the Caledonian
Celt, beyond the Tyne and Solway. The traces of this, however, are
extremely indistinct and uncertain; and so little evidence does
Celtic tradition preserve of the distinction between the refined pantheistic
creed of the Arian races, and the spells and superstitions of
Allophylian aborigines, that the name of Druid, or <i>Druidheadh</i>,
is used only by the modern Gael as significant of a magician or
wizard. Before, however, the hereditary British priesthood had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
driven into the northern fastnesses of the island, if not, indeed, before
his race had effected a landing on its shores, the proofs which we
possess seem clearly to manifest that the Archaic Period of native
art had come to an end, and the last great change within the Pagan
era, resulting from the introduction of the more abundant and more
useful metal, iron, had begun to operate. Within that closing primitive
era we arrive at the first glimpses of authentic records. Thus
much has, meanwhile, proved to be recoverable, in the form of suggestive
inferences, if not of ascertained truths, from amid the dim
shadows that have for ages covered, as with the pall of oblivion, the
history of our national infancy, and of its first youth.</p>

<h2>PART III.<br />

THE TEUTONIC OR IRON PERIOD.</h2>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE INTRODUCTION OF IRON.</h3>


<p>The changes consequent on the introduction of Iron, to a people
already familiar with the smelting of tin and copper ores and the
fabrication of weapons and implements of bronze, were not necessarily
of a radical character, and undoubtedly were first experienced
in the gradual acquirement of the new metal from foreign sources.
Had bronze been obtainable in sufficient quantities to admit of its
application to the numerous purposes for which iron has since been
used, there was nothing to prevent the accomplishment of nearly all
to which European civilisation has since attained, without the knowledge
of the new metal. The opposite, however, was the case. The
metal was costly and scarce, and hence one of the most obvious
sources of the lengthened period over which we have seen reason to
believe that the Archaic era extended. Throughout that whole period
metal in every form was a rare and valued luxury, and it was as such
that iron, the most widely diffused, the most abundant and most
useful of all the metals, was first introduced into the British Isles.
This is sufficiently accounted for from the fact, that iron rarely, if
ever, occurs in nature in a metallic state; and that it requires great
labour and a most intense heat to fuse it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>The age of iron was introduced by a transition-period, occupying
possibly as long a time as that which marked the gradual introduction
of the era of bronze; but it was not characterized by results of
the same direct value. So long as the knowledge of the new metal
merely extended to the substitution, by barter or other means, of iron
for bronze weapons or implements, its influence could be little more
noteworthy than may be the substitution of percussion-caps for flints
in our British standing army, to some archæologist or historian of the
year 1950. But even such traffic, no doubt, tended through time to
make metals more abundant, and metallic weapons and implements
more readily attainable, so that the artisan and fabricator were at
length enabled to dispense entirely with the primeval stone-hammer
and hatchet, and greatly to extend the application of the new and
useful material.</p>

<p>It was only when iron had become thus plentiful that it could be
productive of any effective change on the characteristics of the races
by whom it was used. But though iron is the most abundant of all
the metals, and was the latest to be introduced into use, it is at the
same time the most perishable, rapidly oxidizing, unless preserved by
the most favourable circumstances. Accordingly, very few iron relics,
properly pertaining to the closing Pagan era, have been found in
such a state of preservation as to enable us to make the use of them,
in judging of the skill of their fabricators, which has already been
done with those of the Bronze Period. The new and more useful
metal, however, did not supersede the gold and bronze in their application
to purposes of personal adornment; neither did it put a stop to
the manufacture of pottery, to the use of bronze in the construction
of vessels for sacred or domestic purposes, nor to those sepulchral
rites by which so many evidences of primitive arts and manners have
been chronicled for our instruction. It rather increased all these,
superadding the additional material of silver, wherewith to multiply
the personal ornaments which extending civilisation and refinement
more largely demanded. The superior fitness of the new metal
for the construction of weapons of war would, no doubt, be first discovered
and turned to account. The absence of the guard on all the
swords of the Bronze Period, to which attention has been directed,
no doubt originated mainly in the mode of using the weapon, which
its own capabilities rendered indispensable. The fence and clash of
weapons consequent on modern swordsmanship, in which the sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
is made to supply both offensive and defensive arms, was altogether
incompatible with weapons of cast bronze, liable to shiver like glass
at a violent blow. Experience would soon teach the old swordsman
the true use of his weapon; and so long as he had only to contend
with neighbouring tribes equally armed, he would deem his graceful
leaf-shaped sword and his massy spear of bronze the perfect models
of a warrior's arms. But while the changes which we have aimed at
tracing out in the previous section were progressing slowly but effectively
within our sea-girt isle, very remarkable occurrences were
affecting the continent of Europe, and extending their influences
towards its remotest limits. Carthage had risen from a Tyrian colony,
planted on the site of an older Ph&#339;nician settlement on the African
coast, to be one of the chief commercial and maritime states of the
world. The younger builders on the banks of the Tiber had founded
the capital destined twice to form the centre of universal empire.
Rome and Carthage had come into collision, as was inevitable, according
to the notions of these elder times, which held it impossible
that two ambitious republics should exist as neighbours. The Punic
wars followed, and for upwards of a century&mdash;till 147 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> when the
African capital was razed to the ground&mdash;the seat of war was far
removed from the British Isles. The second Punic war carried the
arms of the rival republics into Spain, and then possibly some faint
rumour of it may have reached the Cassiterides, stimulating for a
time the trade of their ports, and checking it again, as disasters
thickened around the devoted African kingdom. Spain still continued
the seat of war after the total annihilation of the Carthaginian
power; and during the intestine struggles which followed in the Jugurthan
war, there appeared for the first time on the northern frontiers
of Italy, hosts of the Teutones, Cimbri, and other northern barbarians.
By these several Roman armies were defeated, and the growing power
threatened with annihilation from this unexpected source, at the
very time when it seemed to be without a rival. From an incidental
notice of Polybius we learn the important fact that these northern
tribes were already familiar with iron, and possessed of weapons of
that metal, though apparently ignorant of the art of converting it
into steel. One of the earliest European sources of iron, of which we
know anything definite, was the country of the Norici, a tribe occupying
a considerable region to the south of the Danube, the exact
boundaries of which are only imperfectly known. The invention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
the art of converting iron into steel is ascribed to this Celtic race.
Noricum was conquered by Augustus, and, in his time, the Noric
swords were as celebrated at Rome as the Damascus blades or
Andrea Ferraras in more recent times. To this source, therefore, we
should probably look for the earliest supplies of iron weapons. Polybius
also refers to the country of the Norici as abounding in gold; so
that they appear to have excelled in all the metallurgic arts, and
may be supposed to have supplied the arms with which the Teutones
and the Cimbri invaded the Roman frontiers. The latter, indeed,
advanced through Noricum, and bore perhaps from thence the sword
which the haughty Gaul flung into the balance of the Capitol when
Quintus Sulpicius purchased the safety of Rome, not with iron but
gold.</p>

<p>The argument deduced from the apparently independent origin of
the oldest European names of the metals, confirms the evidence derived
from other sources in proof of the ignorance of the Arian
nomades of the working of metals on their first settlement in Europe.
The same line of argument, however, adds strong confirmation to the
conclusion suggested here, that the Celtæ had obtained considerable
mastery of the metallurgic arts at the time when they were brought
into direct intercourse and collision with the growing power of Rome,
and renders it probable that the Romans derived both the names of
some at least of the metals, and their knowledge of their economic
uses from this older race. The Saxon <i>gold</i> differs not more essentially
from the Greek &#967;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#962;, than that from the Latin <i>aurum</i>; or iron,
from &#963;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;, or <i>ferrum</i>; but when we come to examine the Celtic
names of the metals it is otherwise. The Celtic terms are:&mdash;Gold&mdash;Gael.
<i>or</i>; golden, <i>orail</i>; Welsh, <i>aur</i>; Lat. <i>aurum</i>. Silver&mdash;Gael.
<i>airgiod</i>; made of silver, <i>airgiodach</i>; Welsh, <i>ariant</i>; Lat. <i>argentum</i>,
derived in the Celtic from <i>arg</i>, white or milk, like the Greek &#945;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#962;,
whence they also formed their &#945;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;. Nor is it improbable that
the Latin <i>ferrum</i> and the English <i>iron</i> spring indirectly from the
same Celtic root:&mdash;Gael. <i>iarunn</i>; Welsh, <i>haiarn</i>; Sax. <i>iren</i>; Dan. <i>iern</i>;
Span. <i>hierro</i>, which last furnishes no remote approximation to <i>ferrum</i>.
Nor with the older metals is it greatly different: as bronze&mdash;Gael.
<i>umha</i> or <i>prais</i>; Welsh, <i>pres</i>, whence our English <i>brass</i>&mdash;a name bearing
no very indistinct resemblance to the Roman <i>æs</i>. Lead in like
manner has its peculiar Gaelic name, <i>luaidhe</i>, like the Saxon <i>læd</i>,
while the Welsh, <i>plwm</i>, closely approximates to the Latin, <i>plumbum</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
It may undoubtedly be argued that the Latin is the root instead of
the offshoot of these Celtic names, but the entire archæological proofs
are opposed to this idea; and the direct historic evidence of the early
Noric arts, and of the arms of the barbarian invaders of Italy who
dictated terms to Quintus Sulpicius in the Roman Capitol, prove that
the Celtic and Teutonic races of the north of Europe preceded the
Romans in their mastery of the art of working in metals. To this
period, (circa <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 113-100,) or probably a little earlier, while Rome
was preoccupied with the struggle for existence, we may refer the
close of the isolated state of the British Isles, and the irruption of
newer races among the original occupants of the country. This it is,
and not the mere alteration of the old metallurgist's materials, which
gives a totally new character to the Iron Period. The gold and the
bronze are still there, but the shapes which express to us the intellectual
progress of their artificers and owners are essentially changed.
The indefiniteness of archaic art gives place to forms and ornaments
as positive and characteristic as any in which we recognise the expressive
types of medieval art, or the changing fashions of the Elizabethan
and Louis Quatorze styles. It is important that we should
fix as nearly as possible the true date of this change, when for the first
time we find our inquiries bringing us in contact with ascertained
epochs and recorded facts. From this, as from a central point, we
may perhaps yet be able to reckon backward as well as forward, and
at least secure a basis for future observations.</p>

<p>When iron first became known to the native Britons its value was
naturally estimated in accordance with its rarity, and it was applied
to such uses as we now devote the precious metals. Converted into
personal ornaments, it formed rare, if not beautiful trinkets, and in
the shape of ring-money it even superseded or supplemented the older
gold. Julius Cæsar speaks of the Britons as using such a rude currency;
but we may infer from other evidence already referred to that
this did not arise, at that comparatively late period, from its extreme
rarity. Herodian indeed speaks still later of the Britons wearing
"iron about their bellies and necks, which they esteem as fine and
rich an ornament as others do gold." But we have abundant evidence
that they were familiar with the value and beauty of gold, and
we shall not, I think, overstrain the allowances to be made for the
prejudiced accounts of the most intelligent Roman, in receiving even
the narrative of Cæsar with some limitations. His personal oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>tunities
of observation could extend only to a very limited section of
the native Britons, and these seen under the most disadvantageous
circumstances; while the polished and haughty Roman was little
likely to trouble himself with attempting any very impartial estimate
of what were in his eyes only different phases of barbarism.</p>

<p>The fact has already been adverted to, that all the descriptions of
the weapons of the Gauls furnished by classic writers, lead us to the
conclusion that the ancient bronze leaf-shaped sword had been entirely
superseded by the more effective iron weapon prior to their
collision with the veteran legions of Rome. The same is no less true
of the contemporary Britons. Tacitus describes the Caledonians as
"a strong, warlike nation, using large swords without a point, and
targets, wherewith they artfully defended themselves against the
Roman missiles." We know, moreover, that before the Romans
effected a landing in Britain, they were familiar with the fact of an
intimate intercourse having been long maintained with Gaul. The
former is described by Julius Cæsar as the chief seat of a religion
common to both; and the evidence is no less explicit which shews
that many of the southern British tribes were of the same race, and
differed little in arts or customs from the Gauls of the neighbouring
continent. But still more, the reason assigned by Cæsar for the first
invasion of Britain was the provocation its natives had given him by
the aid which they furnished to his enemies in Gaul. There could
not therefore exist any great disparity in their arts or military accoutrements;
while we discover in this no slight evidence of the
maritime skill to which they must have attained even at that early
period, to enable them to embark such bodies of auxiliaries for the
help of the continental tribes as attracted the notice and excited the
indignation of the Roman general.</p>

<p>To the early part of this Age of Iron should most probably be assigned
the construction of the vast monolithic temple of Stonehenge.
Its difference from the older temples of Avebury and Stennis, as well
as from all other British monuments of this class, has already been
referred to. Rude and amorphous as its vast monoliths are, they are
characterized by such a degree of regularity and uniformity of design,
as marks them to belong to a different era from the Avebury or the
Stennis circle, when the temple-builders had acquired the mastery
of tools with which to hew them into shape. Much greater mechanical
skill, moreover, was required to raise the superincumbent masses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
and fit them into their exact position, than to rear the rude standing
stone, or upheave the capstone of the cromlech on to the upright
trilith. Stonehenge, therefore, is certainly not a work of the Stone
Period, and probably not of the Bronze Period, with the exception of
its little central circle of unhewn stones, which may date back to a
very remote era, and have formed the nucleus round which the veneration
of a later and more civilized age reared the gigantic columns,
still so magnificent and so mysterious even in ruin.</p>

<p>The isolation which we have reason to believe had hitherto exercised
so much influence on the native tribes of Britain, is now seen to
be finally at an end. The Celtic races are once more nomade, or
mingling their blood with the more civilized tribes which are gradually
securing a footing in the south-eastern portions of the island.
The first stream of Teutonic colonization had set in, which, followed
successively by the Romans with their legions of foreign auxiliaries,
by Saxons, Angles, Scoti, Norwegians, Danes, and Normans, produced
the modern hardy race of Britons. The term Teutonic has been
adopted here as at once the most comprehensive and definite one by
which to characterize this period. In Scotland the Celtic races
maintained a progressive civilisation which ultimately developed itself
in new forms, producing an essentially Celtic style and era of art at a
later period; but throughout the last Pagan era, the arts of the Celtic
Caledonians appear to have been modified by the same Teutonic influence
as those of South Britain, Gaul, Germany, and Scandinavia.
The tribes of North Britain were indeed only indirectly affected by
the aggressive movements of the earlier Teutonic invaders, and were
probably a pure Celtic race when the Roman legions penetrated into
the Caledonian fastnesses in the second century of our era. But the
close affinity between the relics of North and South Britain abundantly
proves the rapid influence resulting alike from the friendly interchange
of useful commodities and personal ornaments, and doubtless also
from the frequent spoils of war. The beautiful coinage of the British
Prince Cunobeline, (circa <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 13 to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 41,) and supposed to be the
work of a Roman, or of a native monier familiar with Roman art,
exhibits the type which the Gauls imitated from the Didrachmas
and Staters of Macedonia upwards of three centuries before. Little
doubt is now entertained by our best numismatists that the coins of
Comius and others of an earlier date than Cunobeline or the first
Roman invasion, include native British mintage. There is no question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
at any rate, that they circulated as freely in Britain as in Gaul, and
have been found in considerable quantities in many parts of the island.
The iron or bronze and copper ring-money of the first century
must therefore be presumed as only analogous to our modern copper
coinage, and not as the sole barbarous substitute for a minted circulating
medium.</p>

<p>Several interesting discoveries of the primitive iron ring-money
have been made in Scotland, though in no case as yet in such a state
as to admit of its preservation. In a minute description of various
antiquities in the parish of Kilpatrick-Fleming, Dumfriesshire, superadded
to the Old Statistical Account, the contents of several tumuli
opened about the year 1792 are detailed. In one was discovered a
cist, inclosing an urn of elegant workmanship, filled with ashes. The
urn was found standing with its mouth up, and covered with a stone.
At a small distance from it, within the cist, lay several iron rings,
each about the circumference of a half-crown piece, but so much corroded
with rust that they crumbled to pieces on being touched.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> A
similar discovery made in Annandale is thus described by an eyewitness:
"In the centre of the tumulus was found a red flag-stone laid
level on the earth, on which were placed two other slabs of equal size,
parallel to each other; and other two, one at each end; another was
laid on the top as a cover. In the interior of this was an urn containing
ashes, with a few very thin plates of iron in the form of rings,
so completely corroded that when exposed to the air they crumbled
into dust."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> In these frail relics of the new material we can have
little hesitation in recognising the <i>annuli ferrei</i> of Julius Cæsar, used
by the Britons of the first century as their accredited native currency.</p>

<p>Assuming it as an established fact that the native Britons of the
southern parts of the island, at least, had carried the arts of civilisation
so far as to coin their own money, we perceive therein the evidence
of a totally different era from the Archaic Period, in which
direct imitation of the simplest positive forms is hardly traceable.
Bronze, as has been already observed, continued to be used no less
than in the former era, of which it has been assumed as the characteristic
feature, in the manufacture of personal ornaments, domestic
utensils, &amp;c. In Denmark, indeed, some remarkably interesting relics
have been found, seemingly belonging to the very dawn of the last
transition-period, when iron was more precious than copper or bronze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>These include axes consisting of a broad blade of copper edged with
iron, and bronze daggers similarly furnished with edges of the harder
metal. Even in Denmark such examples are extremely rare, and no
corresponding instance that I am aware of has yet been discovered
in Britain. A great similarity is traceable between the bronze relics
of the various northern races of Europe, belonging to the Iron age, and
that not of an indefinite character, like the stone hammer or flint
lance and arrow-heads of the Primeval Period, but a distinct uniformity
of design and ornament, which has mainly contributed to confirm
the prevalent opinion that the majority of British and especially of
Scottish bronze relics are of Danish origin. In examining these relics
in detail, I shall endeavour honestly to assign to Scandinavia whatever
is her own, but if the arguments advanced here have any foundation
in truth, it is obvious that the British Iron age had lasted well-nigh
a thousand years, and as a Pagan era was at an end before we
have any historical evidence of Scandinavian invaders effecting permanent
settlements on our shores. The whole evidence of history
manifestly leads to the conclusion that Britain long preceded the
Scandinavian races in civilisation, nor was it till she had been enervated
alike by Roman luxury and by the succeeding intestine jealousies
and rivalries of native tribes, that Scandinavia, fresh in her young
barbarian vigour, made of her a spoil and a prey.</p>

<p>On none of the native arts did Roman intercourse effect a more
remarkable change than on British fictile ware. From the English
Channel to the Frith of Tay, Roman and Anglo-Roman pottery have
been met with in abundance, including the fine Samian ware, probably
of foreign workmanship, the rude vessels of the smother kiln, and
the common clay urns and coarse amphoræ and mortaria, designed
for daily domestic use. Numerous Anglo-Roman kilns have been
discovered, some of them even with the half-formed and partially baked
vessels still standing on the form or disposed in the kiln, as they had
been abandoned some fifteen or sixteen centuries ago. Cinerary urns
of the same class have been frequently found accompanied with relics
corresponding to the era of Roman occupation. But, be it observed,
the bronze relics of the Teutonic type corresponding in general style
and ornamentation to those discovered in the Scandinavian countries,
when found in British sepulchral deposits are almost invariably accompanied
with the primitive pottery, or with a class of urns, described
in a succeeding chapter, in which we trace the first elements of im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>provement
in the manufacture of native fictile ware. This must
settle the question of the priority of their deposition to the earliest
conceivable era of Scandinavian invasion. The native Britons did
unquestionably greatly degenerate after being abandoned by their
Roman conquerors; but it is opposed alike to evidence and probability
to imagine that they resumed the barbarous arts of an era some
centuries prior&mdash;a proceeding more akin to the ideas of the modern
antiquary than to the practice of a semi-civilized race.</p>

<p>The devices most frequently employed in the decoration of the
gold, silver, and bronze relics of this period, are what are called the
serpentine and dragon ornaments. They are common to the works
of all the northern Teutonic races, and are manifestly to be referred
to the same Eastern origin as the wild legends of the Germano-Teutonic
and Scandinavian mythic poems, in which dragons, snakes,
and other monsters, play so conspicuous a part. Along with these,
however, there are other patterns indirectly traceable to Greek and
Roman models, as is also observable in the dies of the early Gaulish
and British coins. This, however, will be more fully considered in
treating of the personal ornaments of the period, but meanwhile we
may draw the general conclusion, that the arts of the Iron age pertained
to the whole Teutonic races of Northern Europe, and reached
both Denmark and Britain from a common source, long prior to the
natives of these two countries coming into direct collision. We see
that an intimate intercourse was carried on between Britain and Gaul
at the very period when the transition to the fully developed Iron age
was progressing in the former country: it is easy, therefore, to understand
how similar arts would reach the Danish Peninsula and the
Scandinavian countries beyond the Baltic. But Scandinavia had long
passed her Bronze Period, and succeeding transition era, when she
sent forth her hardy Vikings to plunder the British coasts. It was
with other weapons than the small leaf-shaped bronze sword that
the Norse rovers came to spoil and desolate our shores.</p>

<p>In recent cuttings, during the construction of the Dublin and
Cashel Railway, there were found a number of large and heavy iron
swords, which are now deposited in the Museum of the Royal Irish
Academy. These Mr. Worsaae examined during his visit to Ireland
in 1846, and unhesitatingly pronounced them to be Norwegian. "The
swords are long and straight, formed for cutting as well as thrusting,
and terminate in points formed by rounding off the edge towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
back of the blade. The spears are long and slender, and similar in
form to the lance-heads used in some cavalry corps."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> They are
formed of a soft kind of iron, like those referred to by Polybius, as
in use among the Gauls more than a century prior to the invasion of
Julius Cæsar; and, like them, they differ nearly as much in every
essential point, as can well be conceived possible, from the bronze
sword of the previous era, which has been so perseveringly bandied
about by modern antiquaries between Romans and Danes. Mr.
Worsaae especially referred to the great size and weight of the swords
found in Ireland, and contrasted them with the lighter weapons of
the same metal which he believed to be contemporary swords of
the native Irish, from whence he drew the inference that Ireland
was&mdash;like England, France, Germany, &amp;c.&mdash;so weak, from about
the eighth till the twelfth century, in consequence of intestine wars,
that she fell an easy prey to small numbers of Scandinavian invaders.
Mr. Worsaae farther remarked of the weapons found at Kilmainham:&mdash;"They
are so like the Norse swords, that if they were
mixed with the swords found in Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish
tombs, and now in the collections of Christiania, Stockholm, and
Copenhagen, it would be difficult to distinguish one from the other.
The form of the handle, and particularly of the knob at the end of
the handle, is quite characteristic of the Norse swords. Along with
them some other antiquities of undoubtedly Scandinavian origin
were also discovered."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>The source from whence Europe derived this great gift of iron has
yet to be ascertained. It certainly was not from Rome. The Norici,
it has already been observed, furnished the chief supplies of iron to
Rome, and taught her metallurgists the art of converting it into steel.
It is not impossible, however, that it was from the remote North that
this source of civilisation was sent to the Mediterranean coasts. British
antiquaries have obtained as yet only a partial view of Scandinavian
archæology, notwithstanding the valuable publications of Mr.
Worsaae. The ancient land of the Scandinavian races includes Denmark,&mdash;a
country of peculiar geological formation, having abundant
stores of silex in its chalk strata, but no minerals to tempt the skill of
its aboriginal occupants,&mdash;and Sweden, including Norway, a country
abounding in minerals, and still furnishing Europe with the finest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>iron from its native ores. It is remarkable that this latter country
appears, from its primitive relics, to have had its primeval stone
period and birth-time of the mechanical arts, but, with the exception
of the small district of Sweden adjacent to Denmark, so far as yet
appears, this was immediately succeeded by the Iron Period. No
bronze archaic era is indicated in its archæological annals. We cannot
assume from this, as some are inclined to do, that therefore Norway
must have remained an unpeopled waste, while Denmark was
advancing into the period of well developed mechanical and ornamental
arts. With our present imperfect materials for judging, we
are better perhaps to assume nothing, but wait for some able Norwegian
archæologist doing that for his native antiquities which Thomsen
and Worsaae have done for those of Denmark. Yet good evidence
has been furnished in part, especially in one important department,
by Professor Nillson's <i>Skandinaviska Nordens Urinv&auml;nare</i>, or Primitive
Inhabitants of Northern Scandinavia, though in this he assigns
to the true Swea race, and the first workers of the native iron, no
earlier a date as the colonists of Sweden than the sixth century. The
<i>Samlingar f&ouml;r Nordens forn&auml;lskare</i>, already referred to, is also of
considerable avail, especially from its copious illustrations. From
these we learn that the primitive tumuli-builders of Denmark and
Norway are of the same race, and that Norway had her monolithic
era, of which no less remarkable traces remain than that of Denmark.
Hence we are led to ask the question,&mdash;May not her Archaic Period
have been an iron instead of a bronze one, and her forges the source
from whence the Norici and other Teutonic and Celtic races of Europe
learned that the iron-stone was also an ore, and could be smelted and
wrought like the more ductile bronze? Northern mythological traditions
throw some imperfect and uncertain light on this subject.
They refer, for example, to their Gnomes and Dwarfs, their Alfes,
and other supernatural metallurgists, as inhabiting mountain regions
lying beyond and around them. This is peculiarly noticeable in all
the oldest mythic fables, mixed up with the wild inventions of
dragons, serpents, and the like fanciful machinery, which tell of
their far birthland in the older continent of Asia. But it is worthy
of notice, that the topography of these mythological legends in
no way corresponds with the natural features of the Scandinavian
peninsulas, lying as they do between two seas. May we not infer,
therefore, that they had their origin while yet the Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
nomades were wandering towards their final destination between the
Baltic and the German Ocean, and that these distant mountains,
with their metallurgic Gnomes and Alfes, were none other than the
mountain ranges of Norway, the mineral treasures of which now furnish
so valuable a source of national wealth to their descendants?
The Germanic tradition has already been noticed which places the
forge of the mythic Weland in the Caucasus, a fading memorial,
perhaps, of the wanderings of their Teutonic fathers towards their
western home. Such wild traditions must necessarily be used with
much doubt and caution; yet they are not meaningless, nor the
mere baseless offspring of fancy. Other and more direct evidence
may possibly be within reach of the Norwegian archæologist, to induce
the belief that the Alfes of his ancestral myths may have been
a hardy race of Finnish, Celtic, or other primitive metallurgists, who,
like the Norici, supplied the weapons by which themselves were subjugated.
All this, however, is advanced with the greatest hesitation,
not as a theory which it is proposed to maintain, but only as guessings
at truth which lies at present beyond our grasp. By far the
most important iron ore wrought in Norway and Sweden is Magnetite,
which appears to pertain nearly as exclusively to the North as
tin does to the British Isles. The largest known masses occur in
Scandinavia, Lapland, Siberia, and in North America. In Norway,
Arendal is the most important locality; and in Sweden, Dannemora,
Utoe, Norberg, and Taberg. The fine quality of the Magnetite
ores is ascribed to their being mixed with calc-spar, thallite, hornblende,
and other natural adjuncts advantageous for their reduction,
so that the granular ores often require no other flux. Such a condition
of the iron ore was manifestly peculiarly calculated to facilitate
the processes of smelting and fusing, and thereby to adapt it for working
by the primitive metallurgist. Magnetite is not unknown in
several of the remoter parts of Scotland, but the distance from fuel
has hitherto prevented its application to economic purposes, at least
in modern times. Bog iron ore, an hydrated oxide of iron still more
readily fused, is also common in Sweden, and abundant in the northern
and western islands of Scotland; but though well adapted for
castings, it is inapplicable for other purposes. Hæmatite, or specular
iron, is another of the most abundant iron ores specially worthy of
notice here, because it is found in a state more nearly resembling the
metal than any other ore of iron, and occurs in the most ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
metallurgic districts of England, where the previous native industrial
arts were so well calculated to suggest its economic use when observed
in such a form. It appears at Lostwithiel, in Cornwall, in the form
of fine red crystals of pure iron peroxide, and is also found at Tincroft
and St. Just in the same district, and in Devonshire, Wales, Cumberland,
and Perthshire. Such are some of the lights by which mineralogy
enables us to trace out the probable origin of the working of
iron in Europe; but after all, it is to Asia we are forced to return for
the true source of nearly all our primitive arts, nor will the canons of
Archæology be established on a safe foundation till the antiquities of
that older continent have been explored and classified. The advocate
of Druidical theories may find his so-called "Druidical temple" in the
steppes of Asia as well as on Salisbury Plain; and probably very many
other supposed national relics, exclusively appropriated by the local
antiquary, will yet be discovered to have their types and counterparts
in the evidences of primitive Asiatic art.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sepulchral tumuli are spread over all the northern and western parts of Europe,
and over many extensive regions in northern Asia, as far eastward at least as the
river Yenisei. They contain the remains of races either long ago extinct, or of
such as have so far changed their abodes and manner of existence, that the ancestors
can no longer be recognised in their descendants. They abound on the
banks of the great rivers Irtisch and Yenisei, where the greatest numbers of the
then existing people were collected, by the facilities afforded to human intercourse.
In Northern Asia these tombs are ascribed to Tschudes, or barbarians, nations
foreign and hostile to the Slavic race. The erectors of these sepulchral mounds
were equally distinct and separate from the Tartar nations, who preceded Slaves;
for the tombs of the Tartars, and all edifices raised by them, indicate the use of
iron tools; and the art of working of iron mines has ever been a favourite attribute
of the Tartar nations. But silver and golden ornaments of rude workmanship,
though in abundant quantity, are found in the Siberian tombs. The art of fabricating
ornaments of the precious metals seems to have preceded by many ages the
use of iron in the northern regions of Asia."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p></div>

<p>Keeping these important facts in view, which so entirely coincide
with the ascertained truths of primitive European history, it is still
worthy of note that there appears to be something altogether remarkable
in the archæology of Sweden and Norway, destitute as
these countries would appear to be of the traces of the primitive
metallurgic arts discoverable elsewhere, equally in the Asiatic seats
of earliest population, and in the other European countries colonized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
by the Arian nomades. If we accept the conclusions arrived at by
Professor Nillson, that the Swea race did not settle in Scandinavia
till the sixth century, we shall be the more certainly forced to the
conclusion that they were then a people far advanced in the arts of
civilisation; since it is the same race whose powerful fleets are found
ravaging the northern coasts of Europe in the ninth century, establishing
colonies on their shores, and soon after planting Scandinavian
settlements in Iceland, Greenland, and in Vinland on the
continent of North America. Leaving, however, the question of
dates to further inquiry, the curious coincidence of these northern
mythological fables with the topography of the country and the
peculiar characteristics of its primitive antiquities, suggest the conclusion
that the latest intruding race brought with it&mdash;probably from
Asia&mdash;a knowledge of the art of working the metals; and found on
settling in the northern Scandinavian countries that their predecessors
were already familiar with the mineral treasures of the North,
and knew how to smelt the dark iron-stone and convert it to economic
purposes. The latter, according to the craniological investigations of
Professor Nillson, were a race of Celtic origin, having skulls longer
than the first and broader than the second of the two elder races of
the Scandinavian barrows. There is therefore nothing in the ethnological
character of the race inconsistent with such metallurgic skill,
but, on the contrary, much to add to the probability of an early practice
of the arts of the founder and the smith, the Celtæ having shewn,
wherever circumstances favoured it, a remarkable aptitude for working
in metals.</p>

<p>This digression pertains, perhaps, more to general Archæology than
to the direct elucidation of Scottish antiquities. But independently of
the legitimate interest attached to the inquiry into the origin of these
metallurgic arts which brought civilisation in their train, the history
of Scotland at the period we are now approaching is more intimately
connected with Norway than with any other country, except Ireland.
To the primitive Scandinavian literature we still look for some of the
earliest traces of authentic national history; and whatever tends to
illuminate the Iron Period of the North can hardly fail to throw some
light upon our own. This must be the work of the archæologists of
Scandinavia; nor are they insensible to its importance.</p>

<p>The traditional V&#339;lund-myth has already been attempted to be
connected with a definite historic epoch, the reign of King Nidung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
king of Nerika, in Sweden, in the sixth century. Such a mode of interpretation,
however, shews a very imperfect appreciation of the
true nature of this remarkable myth, which belongs in reality to no
single country, but is as essential a link in the history of the human
race as are to each of us the momentous years which form the stage
between infancy and manhood. We cannot, indeed, too speedily
abandon this misdirected aim, of seeking for precise dates of epochs
in primitive history. With these the archæologist, in his earlier historical
investigations, has generally little more to do than the geologist.
Both must rest content with a relative chronology, which yet further
investigation will doubtless render more definite and precise. Where
dates are clearly ascertainable, the archæologist will gladly avail himself
of them; and in this Iron Period much of the indefiniteness of
primeval annals gives place to authentic history. But while rejecting
the localization of the V&#339;lund-myth at the court of Nerika, it is
of importance for our present purpose to note the general evidences
of Scandinavian progress in the arts by which nations attain their
majority. Not in the ninth century only, but perhaps in this era of
King Nidung, in the sixth century, or in the fifth or fourth&mdash;we
know not indeed how early&mdash;the Northmen may have begun to build
ships, and learned boldly to quit their fiords for the open sea. Our
annals prior to the ninth century are so meagre that we must lie
open to the recovery of many traces of important events unnoted
by them, in the interval between that ascertained epoch and the
older one when the Roman legions were compelled to abandon the
vallum of Antoninus, and repair the barrier beyond the Tyne. We
cannot too speedily disabuse ourselves of the idea, that because
no Celtic or Scandinavian Herodotus has left us records of our old
fatherland, therefore the North had no history prior to its Christian
era. We owe to the Romans the history of centuries which otherwise
must have remained unwritten, yet not the less amply filled with
the deeds of Cassivelaunus, Boadicea, Galgacus, and many another
hero and heroine, all unsung; though they wanted but their British
Homer, or Northern Hermes with his graphic runes, to render the
sieges of the White Caterthun as world-famous as that of Troy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

THE ROMAN INVASION.</h3>


<p>The fashion of Scottish archæologists in dealing with our national
antiquities has heretofore most frequently been to write a folio volume
on the Anglo-Roman era, and huddle up in a closing chapter or appendix
some few notices of such obdurate relics of primitive nationality
as could in no way be forced into a Roman mould. Some
valuable works have been the result of this exclusive devotion to one
remarkable epoch; but since this has been so faithfully explored by
Camden, Sibbald, Horsley, Gordon, Roy, Chalmers, and Stuart, there
is good reason why we may be excused following the example of the
Antiquary <i>par excellence</i>, and plunging, "nothing loth, into a sea
of discussion concerning urns, vases, votive altars, Roman camps,
and the rules of castrametation," with copious notations on the
difference between the mode of entrenching <i>castra stativa</i> and <i>castra
æstiva</i>, "things confounded by too many of our historians!"</p>

<p>To English archæologists the Anglo-Roman Period is one of the
greatest importance; for the Romans conquered and colonized their
country, taught its inhabitants their religion, sepulchral rites, arts, and
laws, and, after occupying the soil for centuries, left them a totally
different people than they had found them. There is something,
moreover, in the very geological features of the south-eastern districts
of England, which the Romans first and chiefly occupied, at once
more readily susceptible and more in need of such external influences.
It cannot, indeed, be overlooked, among the elements of ethnological
science, that the geological features of countries and districts exercise
no unimportant influence on the races that inhabit them. The intel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>ligent
traveller detects many indications besides the mere difference
of building materials, when he passes from the British chalk and clay
to the stone districts. To the Romans it can hardly be doubted that
England owes the art of converting her clay into bricks and tiles;
and that in all probability, the P. P. BRI. LON.&mdash;<i>præfectus primæ</i>
<i>[cohortis] Britonum Londinii</i>?&mdash;stamped on recently discovered
Roman tiles found on the site of modern London,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> indicate some of
the products of the kilns by which the inexhaustible bed of London
clay was first converted to economical uses. The Roman mansion,
with its hypocaust and sudatorium, its mosaic paving and painted
walls, its sculptures, bronzes, and furnishings of all sorts, introduced
the refinements of classic Italy into the social life of England; while
the disciplined hardiness of legionary colonists tempered the excesses
of Roman luxury. New wants were speedily created, and many
dormant faculties excited into action among the intelligent native
tribes. The older British pottery entirely disappeared, superseded
by the skilful products of the Anglo-Roman kiln, or the more beautiful
imported Samian ware. England might, and indeed did, greatly
degenerate when deserted by her conquerors, but it was altogether
impossible that she could return to her former state. The footmark
of the Roman on the soil of England is indelible. It forms a great
and most memorable epoch between two widely different periods, the
influence of which has probably never since ceased to operate, and
hence the important place which it still continues to occupy in
English archæology.</p>

<p>The history of the Scoto-Roman invasion is altogether different
from this. It is a mere episode which might be altogether omitted
without very greatly marring the integrity and completeness of the
national annals. It was, for the most part, little more than a temporary
military occupation of a few fenced stations amid hostile tribes.
Julius Cæsar effected his first landing on the shores of Britain in the
year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 55; but it was not till after a lapse of 135 years&mdash;as nearly
as may now be guessed, in the summer of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 80&mdash;that Agricola led
the Roman army across the debatable land of the Scottish border,
and began to hew a way through the Caledonian forests. Domitian
succeeded to the throne of Titus in the following year, while the
Roman legions were rearing their line of forts between the Forth and
the Clyde; and the jealousy of the tyrant speedily wrested the govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>ment
of our island from the conqueror of Galgacus. From that period
till the accession of the Emperor Hadrian, in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 117, the Roman
historians are nearly silent about Britain; but we then learn that the
Roman authority was maintained with difficulty in its island province;
and when Hadrian visited Britain the chief memorial he left of the
imperial presence was the vallum which bore his name, extending between
the Solway and the Tyne. Up to this period, therefore, it is
obvious that the Roman legions had established no permanent footing
in Caledonia&mdash;using that term in its modern and most comprehensive
sense; nor was it till the accession of Titus Antoninus Pius to the
Imperial throne, and the appointment of Lollius Urbicus to the command
in Britain, nearly two centuries after the first landing of Cæsar
in England, that any portion of our northern kingdom acquired a
claim to the title of <i>Caledonia Romana</i>. Lollius Urbicus, the legate
of Antoninus Pius, fixed the northern limits of Roman empire on the
line previously marked out by the forts of Agricola; and beyond that
boundary, extending between the Forth and the Clyde, nearly the
sole traces of the presence of the Romans are a few earth-works, with
one or two exceptions, of doubtful import, and some chance discoveries
of pottery and coins, mostly ascribable, it may be presumed, to the
fruitless northern expedition of Agricola, after the victory of Mons
Grampius, or to the still more ineffectual one of his successor,
Severus. In this extra-mural region, indeed, lies the celebrated
Roman military work, Ardoch Camp, within the area of which was
discovered the sepulchral memorial of Ammonius Damionis, the only
Roman inscription yet found north of the Forth. Such an exception
is the strongest evidence that could be produced of the transitory nature
of Roman occupation in the region beyond the boundaries fixed
by Lollius Urbicus.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the proprætor of Antoninus Pius established
within the line of ramparts which bear the Emperor's name, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 140.
The Roman soldiers are busy building forts; raising each their
thousand or two paces of the wall, and recording the feat on the
legionary tablets which still attest the same; constructing roads and
other military works; and establishing here and there coloniæ and
oppida, with a view to permanent settlement. For a period of about
twenty years, during which Lollius Urbicus remained governor of
the province, peace appears to have prevailed; and to this brief
epoch, when a Roman navy was stationed on the coasts of Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
we may, with great probability, ascribe the rise of Inveresk, Cramond
or Alaterva, and other maritime Roman colonial or municipal sites.
With the death of the able Titus Antoninus, whom grateful Roman
citizens surnamed Pius, all this was at an end. Calphurnius Agricola
had to be despatched by the new emperor, Marcus Aurelius, to
put down an insurrection of the British tribes. The reign of his successor
Commodus was marked by a still more determined rising of the
North. The Caledonian Britons again took to arms, assailed the
legions with irresistible force, defeated them and slew their general,
broke through the rampart of Antoninus, and penetrated unchecked
into the most fertile districts of the Roman province of Valentia,
as it was subsequently named, comprehending the whole district
between the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus which at a later
period became the Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Another legate,
Ulpius Marcellus, had to hasten from Rome to arrest the Caledonian
invaders, and a few more years of doubtful peace were secured to
the northern province. Lucius Septimius Severus succeeded to the
purple <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 197, learned that the Caledonian Britons were once more
within the ineffectual ramparts; and after a few years of timid negotiation,
rather than of determined opposition to these hardy northern
tribes, Virius Lupus, the legate of Severus, was compelled to own
that the occupation of Caledonia was hopeless. The aged emperor
immediately commenced preparations for marching in person against
the Caledonians. About <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 208 he effected his purpose, and entered
Caledonia at the head of an overwhelming force; but it was in vain.
He penetrated indeed as far, it is thought, as the Moray Frith, but
only to return, with numbers greatly reduced, to fix once more the
limits of Roman empire where they had been before marked out by
the wall of Hadrian, between the Solway and the Tyne. It is possible,
indeed, that the northern wall was not immediately abandoned.
At Cramond have been found both coins and medals of Caracalla
and Diocletian. The Roman tenure of the North, however, was
manifestly insecure; and the successor of Severus was little likely
to recover what that able emperor had been compelled to abandon.</p>

<p>A period of sixty-eight years is thus the utmost that can be assigned
for this occupation of Caledonia as a Roman province, and the history
of that brief era is amply sufficient to justify the oft-claimed title&mdash;whatever
be its value&mdash;of the unconquered Caledonians. The tribes
in the immediate vicinity of the garrisoned strongholds of the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>vaders
might be overawed and forced into apparent submission; but
the country was no more subdued and rendered a tributary province
than when Edward made himself the arbiter between Baliol and the
Bruce.</p>

<p>The successors of Severus were glad to secure the forbearance of
the Caledonians on any terms; and for seventy-three years after the
departure of his sons from Britain its name is scarcely mentioned by
any Roman writer. In subsequent allusions to the restless inroads of
the Caledonians on the southern province, they are mentioned for the
first time in the beginning of the fourth century by the name of
Picts; but it is not till the reign of the Emperor Valentinian, in the
latter part of the fourth century, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 367, that we find the Roman
legions under Theodosius effectually coping with the northern invaders,
and recovering the abandoned country between the walls of
Antoninus and Severus. This was now at length converted into a
Roman province, and received the name of <span class="smcap">Valentia</span>, in honour of
the emperor; and to this latter occupation should probably be ascribed
the rise of most of the inland coloniæ, the traces of which are
still recoverable. But its meagre history is that of a frontier province.
The Picts were ever ready to sally forth from their mountain
fastnesses on the slightest appearance of insecurity or intermitted
watchfulness. Again and again they ravaged the southern provinces,
and returned loaded with spoil; and it is chiefly to the notices of
their inroads and repulsions that we owe the possession of any authentic
history of North Britain in the fourth century. Early in the fifth
century, about the year 422, a Roman legion made its appearance in
Scotland for the last time. They succeeded in driving back the Picts
beyond the northern wall, as a disciplined force must ever do when
brought into direct collision with untrained barbarian tribes; but it
was no longer possible to retain the province of Valentia. The
legionary colonists and the Romanized Britons were advised to abandon
it, and once more withdraw within the older limits fixed by
Severus on the line of Hadrian's Wall. So ended the second and last
Roman occupation of Scotland, extending over a period of about fifty
years. It is to this latter era that we should probably assign the
establishment of the Roman town near the Eildon Hills, as well as of
other sites in the interior of the country, bearing traces of Roman
occupation, which it has been customary to seek for among the stations
mentioned by Ptolemy. Roy, for example, adhering to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the names given by Ptolemy, while he rejects the locality which he
assigned to it, fixes the site of &#932;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;, or <i>Trimontium</i>, in the
neighbourhood of the Eildons, because "the aspect of the hills corresponds
exactly with the name."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> In this he has been implicitly followed
by later writers. But <i>Trimontium</i> is a mere Latinized version
of Ptolemy's &#932;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;, and does not necessarily signify <i>Tres Montes</i>,
the supposed designation suggested by the triple summits of the Eildon
Hills; unless, as is possible, the name is only a Greek rendering of the
original <i>Tres Montes</i>, which has been anew transformed into the later
Latin form. Still the mere resemblance of the name to certain features
of an ascertained Roman site is very insufficient evidence in contradiction
to the more precise information of the old geographer, as well as
to the probability of the later origin of the Eildon town. We must
therefore leave Trimontium where Ptolemy places it, in the district
of the Selgovæ, not far from the military station at Birrens, although
it will be shewn that very extensive Roman traces, unknown to
General Roy, do exist in the neighbourhood of the Eildon Hills. The
first period of the Roman presence in Scotland in the second century
was obviously little more than an occupation of military posts; the
second, in the latter end of the fourth century, was the precarious
establishment of a Roman province on a frontier station, and within
sight of a foe ever watching the opportunity for invasion and spoil.</p>

<p>Hence the paucity of Roman remains in Scotland, and the trifling
influence exercised by Roman civilisation on its ancient arts. Roman
pottery has been found in considerable quantities on the sites of well-known
forts and stations, but no Roman kiln has yet been discovered
in Scotland, such as suffices in England to shew how completely
native arts were superseded by those of the Italian colonists. Few,
indeed, of the memorials which the Romans have left of their presence
in Scotland pertain to the practice of the peaceful arts. Their inscriptions,
their altars, and their sepulchral tablets, all relate to the legionary,
and shew by how precarious a tenure his footing was maintained
beyond the Tyne. No evidence serves more completely to prove this
transitory and exotic character of the occupation of the country than
the traces of Roman masonry. Passing beyond the limits assigned
by Hadrian to Roman dominion, the legions entered on a country
the geological features of which are totally dissimilar to any part of
Britain which they had previously acquired. Yet the ruins of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
buildings, discovered in the very centre of the Lothians, shew that
they brought with them the art of the brickmaker, and manufactured
their building materials by the same laborious process above the fine
sandstone strata of the Frith of Forth, as within the chalk and clay
districts of England, where their earliest settlements were effected.</p>

<p>This evidence of the practice of exotic arts becomes still more
noticeable on the sites of some of the wall-stations. At Castlehill, for
example, the third station from the west end of the rampart of Antoninus,
though the fort no longer exists, its materials have been
employed in erecting the farm-offices and inclosures which now occupy
its commanding site. Here, so recently as 1849, an inscribed tablet
of the Twentieth Legion was discovered. On visiting the station the
intelligent observer can hardly fail to be struck with the peculiar
character of the stones built into the new walls, and lying about where
they have been turned up by the plough. The legionary builders would
seem to have found clay unattainable, or inconvenient to work, and
were sufficiently remote from the Clyde to render importation unadvisable.
They have accordingly been compelled to resort to stone;
but true to the more familiar material, they have with perverse ingenuity
hewn it into the shape and size of the common Roman brick,
making in fact, as nearly as possible, bricks of stone. It is not improbable
that similar relics may still exist at some places on the line
of Hadrian's Wall; such, however, is not the case with its more substantial
successor. When Severus abandoned the northern rampart
and rebuilt a wall nearly on the line of that of Hadrian, the Anglo-Roman
occupants of Northumbria were no longer strangers to the
peculiar facilities of the district, and the wall of Severus accordingly
exhibits many traces of substantial masonry, such as antiquaries
familiar only with the Roman remains of the clay districts can scarcely
persuade themselves are the work of the same builders who wrought
with chalk and brick, or bonded even their stone walls in the south
with courses of Roman tile.</p>

<p>Another conclusive proof of the temporary and mere military occupation
of Scotland by the Romans, appears from the fact, that with a very
few exceptions the Scoto-Roman remains have been brought to light
on the line of the Antonine Wall. A very remarkable altar was found
at Inveresk, near Edinburgh, so early as 1565, dedicated <span class="smcap">Apollini</span>
<span class="smcap">Granno</span>, by Quintus Lusius Sabinianus, proconsul of Augustus, which
possesses a singular interest to us from the fact that it attracted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
special notice of Queen Mary of Scotland. In her treasurer's accounts
appears the charge of twelve pence paid "to ane boy passand of Edinburgh
with ane charge of the Queenis Grace, direct to the Baillies of
Mussilburgh, charging thame to tak diligent heid and attendance
that the monument of grit antiquitie, new fundin, be nocht demolisit
nor broken down;" an evidence of archæological taste and reverence
for <i>monuments of idolatry</i>, which probably did not in any degree tend
to raise the queen in the estimation of the bailies of the burgh. The
same ancient relic became an object of interest to Randolph and Cecil,
the ambassador and minister of Queen Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and afterwards furnished
Napier of Merchiston with an illustration of the idols of pagan
Rome when writing his Commentary on the Apocalypse. This remarkable
monument of the Roman colonists of Inveresk must have
been preserved for some generations, as Sir Robert Sibbald mentions
having seen it.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> He died about the year 1712, and the Itinerarium
Septentrionale of Gordon, in which no notice of it occurs, was published
only fourteen years later. The remains of Roman villas with
their hypocausti, flue-tiles, pottery, and other traces of Italian luxury,
have been found at various times in the same neighbourhood, leaving
no room to doubt that an important Roman town was once located on
the spot. A few miles to the west, along the coast of the Forth, the
little fishing village of Cramond is believed to occupy the site of the
chief Roman sea-port on the east of Scotland. There also altars, inscribed
tablets, coins, and other relics, attest the importance of the
ancient <i>Alaterva</i>. Newstead, near the Eildons, has also furnished one
altar, and Birrens, the old <i>Blatum Bulgium</i>, several inscriptions and
sculptures. But even these are nearly all military relics, chiefly of the
first and second Tungrian cohorts; and if to them are added some few
fragments of sculpture and pottery, and examples of bronze culinary
vessels, we have a summary of nearly the whole Roman remains found
in Scotland, apart from the stations on the wall of Antoninus, and the
celebrated Arthur's Oon, the supposed <i>Templum Termini</i>, of which
so much has been written to so little purpose. The earliest writer
who notices this remarkable architectural relic is Nennius, abbot of
Bangor, as is believed, in the early years of the seventh century. His
own era, however, is matter of dispute, and his account sufficiently
confused and contradictory. Its masonry appears to have differed
entirely from any authentic remains of Roman building found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>Scotland, and, indeed, to have had no very close parallel anywhere;
though its form very closely coincided with the round or bee-hive
houses of Ireland, and its masonry was not greatly dissimilar to
that of the Scottish round towers of the same builders, by whom it
was more probably erected. The total absence of cement must at
least be sufficient with most English antiquaries, to throw no little
doubt on its Roman origin. The modern archæologist may be pardoned
if he smile at the enthusiasm of elder antiquaries, who discovered
in this little sacellum, or stone bee-hive, of twenty-eight feet
in diameter and twenty-two feet in height, a fac-simile of "the
famous Pantheon at Rome, before the noble portico was added to it
by Marcus Agrippa," to which Gordon&mdash;the ever-memorable Sandy
Gordon of the Antiquary&mdash;resolved not to be outdone by Dr. Stukely,
adds, "The Pantheon, however, being only built of brick, whereas
Arthur's Oven is made of regular courses of hewn stone!" Sir John
Clerk, writing to Mr. Gale, shortly after the destruction of the Oon,
remarks,&mdash;"In pulling these stones asunder, it appeared there had
never been any cement between them, though there is limestone
and coal in abundance very near it. Another thing very remarkable
is, that each stone had a hole in it which appeared to have been
made for the better raising them to a height by a kind of forceps of
iron, and bringing them so much the easier to their several beds and
courses."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> These facts we owe to the barbarian cupidity of Sir
Michael Bruce, on whose estate of Stonehouse this remarkable and
indeed unique relic stood. The same zealous Scottish antiquary,
quoted above, writing from Edinburgh to his English correspondent
in June 1743, remarks with quaint severity,&mdash;"He has pulled it
down, and made use of all the stones for a mill-dam, and yet without
any intention of preserving his fame to posterity, as the destroyer of
the Temple of Diana had. No other motive had this Gothic knight
but to procure as many stones as he could have purchased in his own
quarries for five shillings!... We all curse him with bell, book,
and candle,"&mdash;an excommunicatory service not yet fallen wholly into
disuse. Of this unique architectural relic sufficiently minute drawings
and descriptions have been preserved to render it no difficult matter
to reconstruct, in fancy, its miniature cupola and concentric courses of
stone; but it still remains an archæological enigma, which the magic
term <i>Roman</i> seems by no means satisfactorily to solve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>The course of Antoninus's rampart and military road lay through
a part of the country since repeatedly selected by later engineers
from its presenting the same facilities which first attracted the experienced
eye of Agricola, and afterwards of Lollius Urbicus, as the
most suitable ground for the chief Roman work in Scotland. Gordon,
it is understood, acquired his chief knowledge of the Roman remains
of this district while examining the ground with a view to the formation
of a projected Forth and Clyde Canal.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> General Roy again
surveyed the same ground, through which at length the Canal, and
still more recently the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, have been
carried; in each case leading to interesting discoveries of Roman
remains.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of these disclosures took place at Auchindavy
during the construction of the Forth and Clyde Canal, when a pit
was discovered within the area of the Roman fort, containing five
altars, a mutilated statue, and two ponderous iron hammers. Four
of the altars, and probably the fifth, had been erected by one individual,
M. Cocceius Firmus, a centurion in the Second Legion, Augusta.
Their position, thus hastily thrown together and covered up on the
spot where they were destined to lie undiscovered for so many centuries,
seems to tell, in no unmistakable language, of the precipitate
retreat of the Roman garrison from the fort of Auchindavy, which
had been committed to the charge of the devout centurion who was
thus compelled to abandon his desecrated aræ. All these, as well as
most of the other relics found from time to time along the line of
the Roman wall, have been deposited in the Hunterian Museum at
Glasgow. They mark most emphatically the dawn of a totally new
era in Scottish archæology. Definite historic annals henceforth come
to the aid of induction. Dates take the place of periods, and individuals
that of races. Unhappily also, with the definiteness of written
records, we come in contact with doubts far more difficult to solve
than many of those which have to be unravelled from the unwritten
primeval records, since it is no longer the accuracy of the induction,
but the veracity of the annalist, that has most anxiously to be looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
to. Such, however, is not the case with the inscribed evidences of
the presence of the Roman legions.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Scottish antiquary the builders of the Caledonian
Wall appear to have taken a peculiar and unprecedented pleasure
in recording their share in this great work, actuated thereto, in
part perhaps, by the reverence with which the name of Titus Antoninus
was regarded alike by Roman soldiers and citizens. These legionary
inscriptions, peculiar to the Scottish wall, indicating the several
portions of it erected by the different legions and cohorts, are most
frequently dedications of the fruit of their labours to the Emperor,
Father of his Country. They are objects of just interest and historical
value, supplying definite records of the legions by whom the country
was held during the brief period of Roman occupation, and meting out
to the modern investigator a measure of information more suited to his
desires than he could hope to recover of so remote and poor a province
of the Roman empire, from the notices of any contemporary
author.</p>

<p>Only one of all the Roman historians, Julius Capitolinus, the biographer
of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, makes any allusion to the
erection of the Caledonian Wall; and on his sole authority, for fully
fourteen centuries, rested the statement that the imperial legate,
Lollius Urbicus, reared the vallum which still in its ruins perpetuates
the name of the Emperor, and preserves, as a visible link between
the present and the past, the northern limit of the Roman world.
The very site of the several British walls was accordingly matter of
dispute, when fortunately, towards the close of the seventeenth century,
a rude and very imperfect fragment of an inscribed tablet was
discovered at or near the fort of Bemulie,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> which in point of historical
value surpasses any Roman relic yet found in Scotland. The inscription
is such a mutilated fragment that the farmer might have
turned it up with his plough and flung it from the furrow, or the
mason broken it up to build into his fence, without either of them
dreaming that it differed in value from any other stone, though its few
roughly inscribed letters supply a fact indispensable to the integrity
of Scottish history. Gordon pronounces it "the most invaluable
jewel of antiquity that ever was found in the island of Britain since
the time of the Romans." It is the fragment of a votive tablet, so
imperfect that it is doubtful whether it be a dedication by the Second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>Legion in honour of the Imperial Legate, or by the latter in honour of
the Emperor. It contains, however, the names of both, and establishes
the only essential fact, that the wall between the Forth and the Clyde
is the work referred to by Julius Capitolinus. The stone, which now
forms one of the treasures of the Hunterian Museum, measures seventeen
by ten inches, and bears the abbreviated and mutilated inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">P &middot; LEG &middot; II &middot; A &middot; <br />
Q &middot; LOLLIO &middot; VR<br />
LEG &middot; AVG &middot; PR &middot; PR</p>

<p>No great error can be committed in thus extending it as a votive tablet
in honour of the Legate, rather than of the Emperor: <span class="smcap">POSUIT LEGIO</span>
<span class="smcap">SECUNDA AUGUSTA QUINTO LOLLIO URBICO LEGATO AUGUSTI PROPRÆTORI</span>.
The ordinary legionary inscriptions include the name and distinctive
titles of the legion, cohort, or vexillation, by whom the number of
paces of the wall recorded on them have been erected; and dedicate
the work in honour of the emperor. The larger tablets are generally
adorned with sculptured decorations, and frequently bear the device
of the legion; that of the Twentieth Legion being the Boar; and probably
that of the Second Legion, surnamed Augusta, the Sea-Goat.
One singular sculptured legionary tablet, however, found at Castlehill,
the site of the third station on the wall, seems to leave little room for
doubt that this fanciful hybrid of the goat and seal was also employed
as the emblematical symbol of Caledonia, and may have been adopted
by the Second Legion to commemorate their victories over the hardy
race whom it not inaptly symbolized. It is a tablet recording with
less abbreviation than usual the completion of 4666 paces of the wall
by the Second Legion, Augusta:</p>

<p class="center monospace">IMP &middot;&nbsp; CAES &middot;&nbsp; TITO &middot; AELIO &middot; <br />
HADRIANO &nbsp; &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp; ANTONINO &nbsp; &middot;<br />
AVG &middot; PIO &middot; P &middot;&nbsp; P &middot; LEG &middot; II<br />
AVG &middot; PER &middot; M &middot; P &middot; IIII &middot; DC<br />
        LXVI &middot; S<br />
</p>

<p>On one side of this inscription appears a literal representation of
imperial triumph:&mdash;captives stripped and bound, above them a
mounted Roman armed and in full career, and over all a female
figure, supposed to bear a wreath emblematic of Victory. On the other
side is the Roman eagle perched on the prostrate sea-goat, the manifest
counterpart of the literal exhibition of the conquered Caledonians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
The origin of the singular emblem, however, is still open to question.
It may be doubted if it was a Roman emblematic device, though
familiar to them as the most usual form of
Capricornus, for the imperial conquerors
more generally adopted the most characteristic
literal representations of the vanquished.
It occurs on a rare coin figured by Gough,
and now ascribed to Comius, about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 45;
but it may also be seen as the zodiacal sign, on a very remarkable
calendar cut in marble, which was found in a ruined villa of Pompeii.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 519px;">
<img src="images/image375.jpg" width="519" height="263" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Roman fort at Castlehill, where the above tablet was dug up,
was one of the inferior class; its small dimensions arising, in part at
least, perhaps, from the natural advantages of its position. The discoveries
on its site, however, are possessed of greater interest than
those yet known belonging to some of the largest stations on the
wall. In the year 1826, a votive altar was brought to light on the
same locality, dedicated, as Mr. Stuart renders it,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> to the Eternal
Field-Deities of Britain&mdash;<span class="smcap">CAMPESTRIBUS ET BRITANNI</span>&mdash;by Quintus
Pisentius Justus, prefect of the fourth cohort of Gaulish auxiliaries;
a cohort which we learn from another altar discovered in Cumberland
was afterwards stationed on the wall of Severus.</p>

<p>There are altogether in the Hunterian Museum six altars, twelve
legionary inscriptions, and several centurial stones, all found along
the line of the Caledonian Wall, besides a few more of each known
to be in private hands. But nearly the whole of these have been so
frequently described and engraved, that it would be superfluous to
repeat their inscriptions here. One interesting discovery, however,
made at Castlehill, since the publication of the Caledonia Romana,
deserves to be noted. It was found during the spring of 1847, by the
plough striking against it, where it lay imbedded in the soil with its
edge upward, as if it had been purposely buried at some former period,
in the shady ravine called the Peel Glen: a dark and eerie recess,
where the <i>Campestres Æterni Britanniæ</i>, the fairies of Scottish folk-lore,
have not yet entirely ceased to claim the haunt accorded to them
by immemorial popular belief. The Roman relic discovered here is a
square slab, considerably injured at the one end, but with the inscription
fortunately so slightly mutilated that little difficulty can be felt
in supplying the blank. The stone measures two feet six inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
greatest length, and two feet four inches in breadth. A cable-pattern
border surrounds it, within which is the inscription.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/image376.jpg" width="582" height="473" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Roman tablet, Castlehill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This sculptured tablet is nearly the exact counterpart of another
legionary inscription found about one hundred and fifty years since
in the neighbourhood of Duntocher. In the latter the number of paces
is defaced in the inscription, and unfortunately the duplicate recently
discovered, which should have supplied the deficiency, is also mutilated,
the break passing through where probably the additional mark
of the fourth thousand originally stood. Both Horsley and Stuart
guessed from the smallness of the space left for the figures in the
former, that it must have been a round number, either III. or IIII.
This argument is equally conclusive in regard to the inscription
recently found, and little doubt can be entertained that the reading
should be four thousand paces. It will doubtless appear to most men
of this nineteenth century a matter of sufficient indifference, now that
the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway occupies the line of the Roman
vallum, whether the vexillation of the Twentieth Legion dedicated three
or four thousand paces of their long obliterated wall to the Emperor
whose name it bore. This tablet, however, establishes an additional
fact suggested by some previous discoveries, that the legionaries were
wont to erect these stones in pairs at the beginning and the end of
their labours, thereby the more distinctly defining the extent of the
work dedicated by them to the favourite emperor. The inscriptions
heretofore found at the Castlehill Station, furnish no evidence of the
presence of the Twentieth Legion as the garrison of that fort. At one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
time it appears to have been held by a detachment of the Second Legion,
Augusta&mdash;the sculptors of the curious emblematic relievo of Caledonian
defeat; and at another by the fourth cohort of Gaulish auxiliaries,
as we learn from the votive altar of their prefect. The former
were doubtless the contemporaries of the Twentieth Legion who, located
at Duntocher, reared there the Roman fort, and constructed the vallum
eastward till it joined the work of the Second Legion at Castlehill.
This is confirmed by the diversity of the sculpture on the two slabs.
Underneath each inscription is the wild boar, the symbol almost invariably
figured on the works of the Twentieth Legion. They are disposed,
however, in opposite directions, so that when the slabs were
placed on the southern or Roman side of the wall, where they would
be seen from the adjacent military road, the boars of the twin legionary
stones would be facing
each other.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Still more recent
agricultural operations
on the Castlehill farm have
brought to light during the
autumn of the present year,
1850, extensive indications
of the remains of buildings
in the immediate vicinity
of the Peel Glen, where the
tablet of the Twentieth Legion was discovered. The most remarkable
feature hitherto exposed by these later operations is the singularly
sculptured base of a column figured here; but these chance discoveries
leave little room to doubt that a systematic trenching of the area of
the fort would amply repay the antiquary for his labour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 616px;">
<img src="images/image377.jpg" width="616" height="387" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Thus minute and circumstantial is the information still recoverable
at this distance of time regarding the Roman colonists of Britain.
Every century yields up some further additional records, and were we
in possession of all the inscriptions graven on votive altars or set up
on tablets and centurial stones, we would possess more ample and
authentic elements for the history of the Roman occupation of Scotland
than all that classic historians supply. Sufficient, however, has
been preserved to furnish a very remarkable contrast between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
relics of the Roman invasion and every other class of the archæological
records of primitive Scottish history.</p>

<p>The whole of the legionary inscriptions and nearly all the altars and
other remarkable Roman remains found on the line of the ancient
vallum, have been discovered at its western end. No railway or other
great public work has traversed its eastern course. The sites of its
forts are uncertain or altogether unknown, and its famous <i>Benval</i> is
not yet so entirely settled as to preclude all controversy, should antiquaries
think the theme worthy of further contest. From time to
time some new discovery adds to our materials for the history of the
Roman occupation of Scotland, and many records of the builders of
the ineffectual rampart of Antoninus probably still lie imbedded beneath
its ruined course. It is more important for our present purpose
to observe that the discoveries which have been made on some
single Anglo-Roman sites greatly exceed all that has ever been
brought to light in Scotland truly traceable to the Roman occupancy.
No archæological relics can surpass in interest or value the legionary
inscriptions peculiar to our Scottish wall, so precise and definitely
minute in the information they have hoarded for behoof of later ages.
But they are purely military records, the monuments, in reality, of
Roman defeat; while of the evidences of Roman colonization and
the introduction of their arts and social habits, it is far short of the
truth to say, that more numerous and valuable Anglo-Roman antiquities
have been brought to light within the last few years at York,
Colchester, or Cirencester, than all the Roman remains brought together
from every public and private museum of Scotland could equal.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is of importance to our future progress that this should be thoroughly
understood. English archæologists, we may be permitted to
think, have devoted their attention somewhat too exclusively to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
remains of a period on which information was less needed than on
most other sections of archæological inquiry. Still the field of Anglo-Roman
antiquities is an ample one, and therefore well-merited to be
explored. But when Scottish archæologists, following their example,
fall to discussing the weary battle of Mons Grampius&mdash;the site of
Agricola's Victoria, founded at Abernethy, or elsewhere&mdash;and the like
threadbare questions, they are but thrashing straw from which the
very chaff has long since been gleaned to the last husk, and can only
bring well-deserved ridicule on their pursuits.</p>

<p>In the present brief glance at the indications of Roman occupation
of Scotland little more is needed for fulfilling the plan of the work than
to note a few of the most interesting Scoto-Roman relics, including such
as have either been discovered since the publication of the "Caledonia
Romana," or have escaped the notice of its industrious and observant
author. It is surprising, however, that under the latter class has to
be mentioned the most beautiful specimen of Roman sculpture existing
in Scotland. In the front of an old house in the Nether-Bow of
Edinburgh there have stood, since the early part of last century&mdash;and
how much longer it is now vain to inquire&mdash;two fine profile heads in
high relief, the size of life, which, from the close resemblance traceable
to those on the coins of Severus, there can be no hesitation in
pronouncing to be designed as representations of the Emperor Septimius
Severus and his Empress Julia. They were first noticed by
Gordon in 1727, and are described by Maitland about twenty years
later, in a sufficiently confused manner, but with the additional local
tradition that they had formerly occupied the wall of a house on the
opposite side of the street. A medieval inscription, corresponding in
reading as well as in the probable date of its characters, to the Mentz
Bible, printed about the year 1455, has been intercalated between the
heads of the emperor and empress, and seems, as it were, to furnish
an earlier witness from the fifteenth century, to say that the Roman
sculpture is still <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>It admits of serious doubt whether the discovery at Copenhagen,
in the last century, of the work of Richard of Cirencester ought to be
viewed as any great benefit conferred on British archæology. The
compilation of a monk of the fourteenth century, even as supplementary
to the geographical details of Ptolemy, can hardly be received
with too great caution, but used as it has been almost entirely to
supersede the elder authority, it has in many instances, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
in relation to our northern Roman geography, proved a source of
endless confusion and error. Without, however, aiming at reconstructing
the Ptolemaic map of Caledonia, we have abundant evidence that
various important Coloniæ were established, which have received no
notice, either in Ptolemy's geography or the "De Situ Britanniæ"
of the monk of Westminster, whom antiquaries may be pardoned
suspecting to have assumed the cowl for the purpose of disguise,
being in truth a monk not of the fourteenth but of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Attracted by the supposed correspondence of the triple
heights of the Eildon Hills to the designation of Ptolemy's <i>Trimontium</i>,
General Roy sought in their neighbourhood for the evidences
of a Roman station, and though less successful than he desired, he
found sufficient indications of the convergence of the great military
roads towards this point, to induce him to conclude "that the ancient
Trimontium of the Romans was situated somewhere near these three
remarkable hills, at the village of Eildon, Old Melros, or perhaps
about Newstead, where the Watling Street hath passed the Tweed."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
Though the propriety of assuming this as the site of Trimontium is
questioned, the sagacious conclusions as to a Roman site detected by
the practical eye of General Roy, have since been amply confirmed
by the discovery of undoubted traces of a Roman town at the base
of the Eildon Hills. Stuart has engraved an altar dedicated to the
forest deity Silvanus, by Carrius Domitianus, a centurion of the
Twentieth Legion, which he describes as "a few years since discovered,
not far from the village of Eildon."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> As this discovery is of considerable
value as a clue to the true site of this central Roman town
within the province of Valentia, it is worthy of note that it was
found on the 15th of January 1830, in digging a drain, about three
feet below the surface, in a field called the Red Abbey Stead, near
Newstead, a village to the north of Eildon, and directly east of
Melrose.</p>

<p>More recently the Hawick Railway has been carried through the
vale of Melrose, and in its progress has added further evidence of the
presence of the Roman colonists on the site, while the ordinary course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>of agricultural operations has exposed numerous foundations of
buildings, Roman medals and coins, and a regular causewayed road,
undoubtedly the ancient Watling Street. This road was laid bare only a
year or two before, in the progress of draining a field called the "Well
Meadow," immediately to the west of the Red Abbey Stead. It was
about twenty feet broad, and was entirely excavated by the tenant,
in order to employ its materials for constructing a neighbouring
fence. In the course of removing it the foundations of various houses
were exposed, and a sculptured stone was discovered, considerably
mutilated, but still bearing on it, in high relief, the wild boar, the
well-known device of the Twentieth Legion. As this corresponds
with the inscription on the altar previously discovered, there can be
little question that the roadway and other military works of this
important station, were executed by the same legion. Another sculptured
portion of an inscribed tablet, found in the same field, evidently
of Roman workmanship, retains only the fragmentary letters
CVI. Among the numerous foundations of ancient buildings much
Roman pottery has been dug up, including the fine red Samian ware,
the black, and the coarser yellowish or grey fragments of mortaria
and other common domestic utensils. It is not improbable, indeed,
that the name of Red Abbey Stead has been conferred on the site of
the Roman colonia, owing to the colour of the soil and the characteristics
of the remains of ancient building so frequently exposed,
arising from the presence of numerous fragments of Roman brick and
pottery. By the same means the course of the Antonine Wall may
frequently be traced in the new ploughed fields on its site, where all
other indications have disappeared. There is no evidence of any abbey
having ever existed on the site; but surrounded as the district is with
Newstead and New and Old Melrose, the seats of ancient ecclesiastical
establishments, the discovery of the brick foundations of extensive
buildings would very naturally suggest the local name of the Red
Abbey. It was in the immediate neighbourhood of this Roman site
that one of those curious subterranean structures was discovered,
which has been referred to in an earlier chapter.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of 1846, during the excavations for the Hawick
branch of the North British Railway, several circular pits or shafts
were laid open a little to the east of the village of Newstead, and
nearly on the line of the Roman road, an additional portion of which
was exposed by the railway-cutting. Two of these shafts were regularly
built round the sides with stones, apparently gathered from the
bed of the river, and measured each two feet six inches in diameter, and
about twenty feet deep. The others greatly varied both in width and
depth, and were filled with a black fetid matter, mixed with earth,
and containing numerous fragments of pottery, oyster shells, antlers
of the red deer, and bones and skulls of cattle, apparently the <i>Bos</i>
<i>Longifrons</i>: the skulls being broken on the frontal bone as if with the
blow of a pole-axe, or possibly of the sacrificial securis. A piece of
a skull discovered in the same place seems to have been that of a
small-sized horse. In one of the pits the skeleton of a man was found
standing erect with a spear beside him, and accompanied with mortaria
and other undoubted remains of Roman pottery. The spear-head,
which measures fourteen inches in length, and only one and a quarter
in greatest breadth of blade, is figured here. The skull has been
already described and compared with the crania of the Scottish tumuli
in a previous chapter;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and the weapon represented here, as well as
various mortaria, urns, coins, and other relics from the same locality,
are now in the possession of John Miller, Esq., C.E., under whose
direction the railway was constructed. A bronze kettle, lachrymatories,
bricks, clay tubes, stones cut with the cable-pattern and the
like familiar classic mouldings, and numerous other Roman remains,
all attest the important character of the Roman town on this site.
Coins from the same locality are also in the possession of Thomas
Tod, Esq., of Drygrange, and Dr. J. A. Smith. In so far as these are
to be received in evidence of the length of time during which the
Eildon station was occupied, they extend over a longer period than
we have any reason to believe the Roman colonists possessed the province
of Valentia; including those of Vespasian, Domitian, Hadrian,
Antoninus Pius, and Severus, as well as of Diocletian, Maximianus,
Carausius, Constantius Chlorus, and Constantine. It is to be borne in
remembrance, however, that among the Britons of that early period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>a coin was money whose ever image or superscription it bore, and
doubtless the Roman mintage continued to circulate long after the
last of the military colonists had abandoned the province of Valentia.</p>

<p>Directly to the north, on the line of the road discovered in the Well
Meadow, there existed, in the memory of some few village patriarchs,
the foundations of a bridge on the banks of the Tweed, which also
may be assumed as the work of the Twentieth Legion. It appears to
have attracted the notice of General Roy, as he speaks of the Watling
Street having crossed the Tweed about Newstead. Continuing our
course northward along this ascertained Roman route, we are once more
left to the guidance of the recent interpreters of Ptolemy and the believers
in Richard of Cirencester, though it is possible with the aid
both of new and old evidence to fix another portion of the route
which has heretofore been misplaced. The assigned old Roman Iter
proceeds from Eildon to the supposed <i>Curio</i> or <i>Curia</i>, near Borthwick&mdash;a
site still requiring confirmation&mdash;and thence directly to the Roman
port of Cramond or Alaterva.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 617px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Bronze Lamp found at Currie.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The southern shores of the <i>Bodotria Æstuarium</i>, or Frith of Forth,
bear more abundant traces than almost any other Scottish district of
continuous occupation by Roman colonists; doubtless owing, in part
at least, to the frequent presence of the fleet in the neighbouring
estuary. If Alaterva,
to whose Deæ Matres
one of its altars was
dedicated, be indeed
the ancient name of
Cramond, no such epithet
is to be found in
the old itineraries, nor
has a classic name been
suggested for the no less important Roman town at Inveresk; unless
that one zealous local antiquary<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> has recently conceived the possibility
of establishing its claims to be the true Curia, hitherto located
elsewhere on very slender and inconclusive evidence.</p>

<p>Following the course of the assigned Roman route from the supposed
<i>Curia</i> at Currie, near Borthwick, it is carried by Roy, in his
revised map, by a westerly sweep towards Cramond, leaving the rocky
heights of Edinburgh some two miles to the east of it, and joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Inveresk, in the maps of Chalmers and Stuart, by imaginary crossroads,
sufficiently satisfactory on paper. A totally different arrangement
may, however, be shewn to have been followed in laying down
the Roman military roads of this district. Earlier writers were not so
ready to exclude the Scottish capital from Roman honours: <i>e.g.</i>,&mdash;"The
town of Eaden," says Camden, "commonly called Edenborow, the
same undoubtedly with Ptolemy's &#931;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#957; &#928;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957;, <i>i.e.</i>, Castrum
Alatum."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Sir Robert Sibbald was one of the first of our Scottish
authors to place a Roman colonia at Edinburgh, but without advancing
any satisfactory grounds for such a conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> "Some," says he,
"think Edinburgh the <i>Caer-Eden</i> mentioned in the ancient authors."
Others, equally bent on maintaining the honour of the Scottish metropolis,
found in it the Alauna of Ptolemy, and in the neighbouring Water
of Leith the Alauna Fluvius&mdash;a discovery perhaps not unworthy to
match with that of Richie Moniplies when he sneered down the
Thames with ineffable contempt in comparison with the same favourite
stream! Such arguments, like those for too many other Romano-Scottish
sites, were mere theories, unsupported by evidence, and little
more can be advanced in favour of the supposed <i>Castrum Alatum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
Later writers on the Roman antiquities of Scotland have accordingly
excluded Edinburgh from the list of classic localities. There are not
wanting, however, satisfactory traces of Roman remains on the site of
the Scottish capital, a due attention to which may help to furnish
materials for a revised map of the Roman Iter.</p>

<p>There passes across the most ancient districts of Edinburgh, and
skirting the line of its oldest fortifications, a road leading through
the Pleasance,&mdash;so called from an old convent once dedicated to S.
Maria de Placentia,&mdash;St. Mary's Wynd,&mdash;another conventual memorial,&mdash;Leith
Wynd, St. Ninian's Row, Broughton, and Canonmills, right
onward in the direction of the ancient port of Alaterva. Probably
more than fourteen hundred years have elapsed since Curia and
Alaterva were finally abandoned by their Roman occupants, and the
dwellings of the Eildon colony were left to crumble into ruins; yet
the traces of the Romans' footsteps have not been so utterly obliterated
but that we can still recover them along the line of this old
road, so deeply imprinted with the tread of later generations.</p>

<p>In the year 1782 a coin of the Emperor Vespasian was found in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>garden in the Pleasance, and presented by Dr. John Aitken to the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,&mdash;the first recent recovery, so far
as is known, of any indications of the Roman presence on the highway
which it is now sought to retrace to a Roman origin. Much
more conclusive evidence has, however, since been brought to light.
In digging in St. Ninian's Row, on the west side of the Calton Hill,
in 1815, for the foundations of the Regent Bridge, a quantity of fine
red Samian ware, of the usual embossed character, was discovered.
It was secured by Thomas Sivright, Esq. of Southhouse, and remained
in his valuable collection of antiquities till the whole was sold and
dispersed after his death.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> In 1822, when enlarging the drain by
which the old bed of the North Loch, at the base of Edinburgh
Castle, is kept dry, portions of an ancient causeway were discovered
fully four feet below the modern level of the road. Some evidence of
its antiquity was furnished on the demolition, in 1845, of the Trinity
Hospital, formerly part of the prebendal buildings of the collegiate
foundation of Queen Mary of Gueldres, founded in 1462, when it was
discovered that the foundations rested on part of the same ancient
causeway;<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> and on the demolition of the venerable collegiate church
an opportunity was afforded me of examining another portion of it
above which the apsis of the choir and part of the north aisle had
been founded. The conclusion which its appearance and construction
immediately suggested, was that which further investigation so
strongly confirms, that these various remains indicate the course of a
Roman road. It was composed of irregular rounded stones, closely
rammed together, and below them was a firm bed of forced soil
coloured with fragments of brick, bearing a very close resemblance to
the more southern portions of the same Roman military way recently
exposed to view in the vale of Melrose. The portions of it discovered
in 1822 included a branch extending a considerable way eastward
along the North Back of Canongate, in a direct line towards the well-known
Roman road in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, popularly
styled "The Fishwives' Causeway."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Here, therefore, we recover the
traces of the Roman way in its course from Eildon to Alaterva, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>a diverging road to the important town and harbour at Inveresk,
shewing beyond doubt that Edinburgh had formed an intermediate
link between these several Roman sites. The direction of the road,
as still visible in the neighbourhood of Cramond in the early part of
the eighteenth century, completely coincided with the additional portion
of it thus recovered. "From this same station of Cramond,"
says Gordon, "runs a noble military way towards <i>Castrum Alatum</i>,
or Edinburgh; but as it comes near that city, it is wholly levelled
and lost among the ploughed lands."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Within a few yards of the point where this ancient Roman road
crosses the brow of the hill on which the ancient Scottish capital is
built, are the beautiful bas-reliefs above referred to, the heads of the
Emperor <span class="smcap">Septimius Severus</span> and his wife <span class="smcap">Julia</span>. I have already suggested
elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> that these sculptures, which in Maitland's time,
1750, were said to have been removed from a house on the opposite
side of the street, have probably been discovered in digging the foundations
of that building. This idea has received striking confirmation
during the present year, (1850.) In the progress of laying a
new and larger set of pipes for conveying water to the palace of
Holyrood, the whole line of the High Street has been opened up, the
workmen in many places digging into natural soil, and even through
the solid rock. In the immediate neighbourhood of the site of the
old "Heart of Mid-Lothian," several coins were found, including
one of Henry IV. of France, bearing the date 1596; and lower
down the street, two silver denarii of the Emperor Septimius Severus
were discovered, in good preservation, not many feet from the locality
of the Roman sculptures. The reverse of the one represents a soldier
armed, and bearing the figure of victory in his right hand&mdash;legend,
<span class="smcap">AVGG &middot; VICT.</span>, and of the other a female figure in flowing
drapery, bearing in the right hand a wreath, and in the left a cornucopia&mdash;the
legend illegible. The prejudices of a strong local partiality
induce me to look upon these traces of Roman presence on a spot
which formed the battle-ground of Scotland during the "Douglas
Wars," as well as in older struggles, with an interest which I cannot
hope to communicate to archæologists in general, but which to many
of them may perhaps seem a pardonable excess. The visit of the
Emperor Septimius Severus, and still more, of his Empress,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>distant corner of the Roman world, were incidents of a sufficiently
unusual occurrence to be commemorated by those who have left records
of every few thousand paces of an earthen vallum which they erected.
If we suppose the road which has been traced out in continuation of
the Watling Street to have been the route by which the Emperor
journeyed northward&mdash;as there is good probability that it must have
been&mdash;we may imagine him pausing on the brow of the hill, just
above the steep slope occupied by Leith Wynd, and catching the
first view of the Bodotrian Frith, with the Roman galleys gliding
along its shores, or urged with sail and oar towards the busy sea-port
of Alaterva, now the humble fishing village of Cramond. On this
spot it seems probable that some important memorial of this distinguished
Emperor's visit had been erected, of which the beautiful
sculptures still remaining there formed a prominent feature. Overthrown
amid the wreck of Roman empire, they may have lain interred
for many centuries; for within a very short distance of their
present site, recent discoveries have brought to light medieval sculptures
and remains of buildings many feet below the foundations of
those of the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>These, however, are not the sole evidences of the occupation of
Edinburgh by the Romans. In the Reliquiæ Galeanæ, of date March
1742, Sir John Clerk thus describes "a Roman arch discovered at
Edinborough,"&mdash;"Just about the time that your structure at York
was pulled down, we had one at Edinborough which met with the
same fate. It was an old arch that nobody ever imagined to be Roman,
and yet it seems it was, by an urn discovered in it, with a good
many silver coins, all of them common, except one of Faustina Minor,
which I had not. It represents her bust on one side, and on the reverse
a <i>lectisternium</i> with this inscription, <span class="smcap">SÆCULI FELICITAS</span>."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> It is
much to be regretted that this information is not more precise, both
about the other coins and the arch in which so remarkable a deposit
was found. Such as it is, however, it is of great value. To
these traces of the Roman presence there remain to be added the
sculptured heads which formerly adorned the old Cross of Edinburgh,
demolished in 1756, and described by Arnot as apparently of the
Lower Empire&mdash;an opinion to be received with some doubt. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>digging the foundation of a large reservoir erecting on the Castlehill,
during the present season, among various very remarkable discoveries,
to be afterwards noticed, there was found another relic of
the Lower Empire, a single copper coin, in excellent preservation,
struck under Constantine the Great.</p>

<p>Pennant describes in his Second Tour, "certain curiosities in a
small but select private cabinet," found in the neighbourhood of
Edinburgh, which had escaped his notice on his former visit. Notwithstanding
their very great local value they have experienced the
usual fate of private collections, and are no longer known. "Among
other antiquities in the cabinet of Mr. John Macgouan, discovered
near this city, is an elegant brass image of a beautiful Naiad, with
a little satyr in one arm. On her head is a wine-vat or some such
vessel, to denote her an attendant on Bacchus; and beneath one foot
a subverted vase, expressive of her character as a nymph of the fountains."
If this beautiful group still exists the description must
render it easily identified. Other relics in the same private collection,
and it may be assumed, from the connexion, included in
Pennant's description as discovered in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,
are a bronze vessel with a perforated top, possibly designed
for incense, and an iron scourge or <i>flagrum</i>, one of the dreadful instruments
of torture used by the Romans, chiefly for the discipline
of slaves, but afterwards employed in the persecutions of the primitive Christians.
Lastly, it is not unworthy of note, in passing, that
in the foundations of the ancient Chapel of St. Margaret, in the
Castle, an early Romanesque work, there are bricks which may possibly
be only fragments of medieval floor-tiles, but which more readily
suggest the idea of their being traces of older Roman buildings, similar
to those which remained in the contemporary Church of St.
Michael at Inveresk, until its recent demolition, and are still recognised
amid the later masonry of Dumbarton Castle, the <span class="smcap">Theodosia</span> of
Richard of Cirencester. Independently of this, however, evidence
enough has, I think, been adduced to establish the fact that a Roman
colonia existed on the site of Edinburgh. Yet it was not without
reason that this was assumed as probable by older Scottish antiquaries
in the absence of such proof, since the admirable military positions
presented by the locality are too obvious to have escaped the
practised eyes of the Roman engineers established on the neighbouring
coast; especially as they had previously been occupied by the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Britons, as is manifest by the discoveries of their cists and cinerary
urns, as well as of their primitive weapons, in the immediate vicinity.
Taking these latter arguments into consideration, the mere fact of
the Roman roads from Newstead&mdash;and perhaps Curia&mdash;from Cramond
and Inveresk, all meeting in the valley between the Calton and
the Castle Hills, is of itself good presumptive evidence in favour of
a Roman post having occupied the site.</p>

<p>It need not excite surprise that traces of Roman occupation should
be found in localities unnoted in the pages of Ptolemy. We may
rather wonder that history should furnish the amount of information
it does regarding the brief presence of the legions in a country from
which they returned with such dubious accounts of triumph. Among
the Romano-British relics in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland, are a circular bronze ornament, an elegant foot of
a bronze tripod in form of a horse's leg and hoof, and a small figure
of Minerva on a pedestal of brass gilt, measuring nearly three inches
high, all found at different times in East-Lothian. The last relic
is not to be compared, however, to another
bronze in the same collection, a figure of
the goddess Pallas Armata, five inches in
height, dug up in the neighbourhood of the
Kirkintilloch station on the Roman wall,
and presented to the Society in 1786. It is
a beautiful work of art; but the most remarkable
feature about it is the spear which
the goddess holds in her hand, bearing an
exact resemblance to the tilting-spear of the
middle ages.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/image389.jpg" width="281" height="553" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the same collection are also preserved
a bronze stamp, discovered near the village
of Carrington, Mid-Lothian, bearing the inscription,
which is reversed, in bold relief,
<span class="smcap">TVLLIAE TACITAE</span>; and a bronze key of undoubted
Roman workmanship, found within
a camp-kettle, in a moss near North-Berwick Law,&mdash;probably the
same locality where a quantity of bronze vessels were recently dug up,
as already described. In addition to these must be noted the exceedingly
beautiful bronze lamp four and three-fifth inches in length,
figured on a previous page, found along with a small and rudely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
executed bronze eagle, at Currie, Mid-Lothian. These remarkable
Roman relics will probably be considered sufficient to establish the
fact, that the Roman road had passed through that line of country.
They will add, however, only a very slight addition to the unsatisfactory
evidence on which the last named place has been assumed
to be the site of the Roman Curia&mdash;heretofore on little better authority
than the correspondence between the ancient and modern names.
Gordon describes another "most curious Roman lamp of brass, adorned
with a variety of engravings," found at Castlecary.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>"As you very well notice," writes Sir John Clerk to his friend and
correspondent Mr. Roger Gale, "Ptolemy mistook several Latin names
when he rendered them into Greek. Of this kind, as I suspect, is
his &#928;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#931;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#957;, <i>Castrum Alatum</i>, which our antiquarians
have applied to Edinburgh. I rather believe that the place designed
by Ptolemy is an old Roman station on the sea-coast, which we call
Cramond, and that it was anciently called, not <i>Castra Alata</i> but
<i>Alatervum</i>, or <i>Castra Alaterva</i>." To this Mr. Gale replies, with
equally cogent arguments for restoring the Castra Alata to the
winged heights of Edinburgh, on which we need not enter here,
having already sufficiently discussed the question of the latter's
claims as a Roman site. While, however, Edinburgh has undergone
the ceaseless changes which centuries bring round to a densely populated
locality, Cramond was in all probability abandoned to solitude,
or at most occupied by a few fishermen's huts when deserted by its
Roman founders. Hence the traces of its ancient colonists have
been discovered in great abundance in recent times. An almost incredible
number of coins and medals, in gold, silver, and bronze,
have been found at different periods, of which Gordon mentions between
forty and fifty of special note which he examined in Sir John
Clerk's possession. Sibbald, Horsley, and Wood, all refer in similar
terms to the valuable numismatic treasures gathered on this Roman
site, including an almost unbroken series of imperial coins from
Augustus to Diocletian; and thereby proving that the ancient Alaterva
had not been abandoned to utter solitude on the retreat of Severus.
Some rare and valuable medals have also been discovered among its
ruins, including one of the Emperor Septimius Severus, inscribed on
the reverse, <span class="smcap">FVNDATOR PACIS</span>, and supposed to have been struck to
give the character of a triumph to the doubtful peace effected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
him with the Caledonians.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Three altars have been found at Cramond;
one sacred to Jove, one to the Deæ Matres of Alaterva, and the third,
figured by Horsley, and assigned by him, as well as by later writers,
to the favourite forest deity Silvanus. The obvious resemblance,
however, of the sculpture on the last altar to an Anglo-Roman
mosaic, now in the British Museum, representing the sea-god Neptune
with horns of lobster's claws, and dolphins proceeding from his
mouth, leaves little room for doubt that the colonists of the chief
Roman port on the Bodotrian Frith had more appropriately dedicated
their altar to the ruler of the waves.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The large altar found at
Cramond, dedicated to the Supreme Jove, formerly in the Advocates'
Library, and now deposited in the Scottish Antiquarian Museum, has
been frequently engraved. It is thus inscribed,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
I O M<br />
COH &middot; V &middot; GALL &middot; <br />
CVI &middot; PRÆEST&nbsp;<br />
IMINE &middot; HONV<sup>IS</sup><br />
TERTVLLVS&nbsp;<br />
PRAEF &middot; V &middot; SL<br />
L &middot; M<br />
</p>

<p>Its well-known inscription is repeated here, in order to associate it
with another relic found at Cramond, probably prior to the discovery
of this altar, which attests the presence of the same Roman Prefect,
Imineus Honorius Tertullus, at the station of Alaterva. Among the
numerous Roman remains acquired by Sir John Clerk from this interesting
locality, and now preserved at Penicuick House, is a bronze
stamp, measuring two and three-eighths by one and a half inches. It
is surmounted by a crescent, and bears the words, in raised letters of
half an inch in height, <span class="smcap">TERTVLL. PROVINC</span>. The inscription is reversed,
having evidently been designed for use as a stamp, and on the back
is a ring handle in form of a bay leaf. A centurial inscription of
the Second Legion, Augusta, a sculptured figure of the imperial eagle
grasping the lightning in its talons, with numerous carved stones,
bricks, flue-tiles, and pottery, have from time to time been recovered
on the same Roman site. To these may be added another inscription,
derived from the Morton MS., presented in 1827 to the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland, by Susan, Countess-Dowager of Morton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>It is indorsed, "Ancient inscriptions on stones found in Scotland,"
and is supposed to have been written by James, Earl of Morton,
president of the Royal Society, who died in 1786. Some of the inscriptions
appear to have been derived from Camden and other well-known
authorities; but others, including the following imperfect
relic, are probably nowhere else preserved. Even in its extremely
mutilated and fragmentary state, it is, perhaps, not altogether unworthy
of preservation. It is thus described,&mdash;"This inscription is
on a stone on the east end of the church of Cramond, in West-Lothian,
[<i>Mid-Lothian</i>,] being three foot long, and one foot and a half broad,
having four lyons drawn on it, all being almost worn out,"</p>

<p>This inscription escaped the notice of Wood when preparing his history
of the parish, or was perhaps thought to be too imperfect to be
worth recording, and it now no longer exists.</p>

<p>Another Scottish stream bearing the name of the Almond forms a
tributary of the Tay, and is also associated, by the remarkable discoveries
on its banks, with the memory of the legionary invaders. A
Roman camp, once in good preservation, has been nearly obliterated
by the encroachment of the stream on its banks; but the changes
which destroyed its entrenchments have brought to light still more
satisfactory traces of their constructors. The most interesting of
these is a bar of lead of 73 lbs. weight, marked thus&mdash;</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/392.png" width="129" height="45" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>(X J XXXX<sup>II</sup>,</p></div>
</div><p>beside
which lay the remains of a helmet and spear, nearly consumed by
rust. Another stamped pig of lead was found at Kirkintilloch, on the
line of the wall; and examples from various English localities, inscribed
with the names and titles of Roman Emperors, are preserved in the
British Museum, and in private collections. One of these, marked
<span class="smcap">IMP. ADRIANI. AVG</span>, supplies a new argument relative to ancient British
metallurgy. It was found near the lead mines of Mr. More of Linley
Hall, county Salop, where an old drift, distinguished from those of
modern date by various evidences of imperfect mining, is still designated
the Roman Vein. Ancient mining tools have been found in it,
and Sir R. I. Murchison states his opinion that the block of lead is the
product of the neighbouring British mine.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Another pig of lead, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>its Roman inscription partially defaced by oxidation, was recently dug
up at Chester, and is figured in the Journal of the Archæological Association,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
along with one found at Broughton Brook, Hants, and still
preserved at Bossington Park. The latter is inscribed <span class="smcap">NERONIS. AVG.
EX. KIAN. IIII. COS. BRIT.</span>, and supplies a remarkably interesting example
of the historical value frequently pertaining to such relics. The
inscription refers to the Cangi or Kiangi, immediately prior to the
reverses experienced by the Romans from the courage and skill of
the heroic Boadicea. The precise date is furnished, Nero having
been consul for the fourth time only the year before; and it is suggested,
with great probability, that this block of lead was on its way
for exportation, composing part of the tribute, the harsh exaction
of which contributed to incite the Britons to resistance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 547px;">
<img src="images/image393a.jpg" width="547" height="417" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Among minuter relics belonging to the same period, the dentated
bronze ring figured here, from the original in the Museum of
the Scottish Antiquaries, is worthy of
some note from the rarity of such objects
in Britain. It was discovered near Merlsford,
on the river Eden, Fifeshire, and
closely corresponds to another example
found in Suffolk, and figured in the Archæological
Journal, where it is remarked that
objects of this kind are frequently met with
in Continental collections, but have rarely,
if ever, been found in this country.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> They occur with one, two, and
three rows of teeth. Sir Samuel Meyrick describes them as dentated
rings, the form apparently suggested by the <i>Murex</i> shell, and supposes
them to have been attached to the whirling arm of a military flail.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/image393b.jpg" width="582" height="179" alt="" />

<p>But by far the most
remarkable of the recently
discovered remains
of the Roman
occupants of Scotland
is a medicine stamp,
acquired by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, along with a very
valuable collection of antiquities, bequeathed to them by E. W. A.
Drummond Hay, Esq., formerly one of the secretaries of the Society.
From his notes it appears that it was found in the immediate vicinity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>of Tranent Church, East-Lothian, in a quantity of debris, broken tiles,
and brick-dust, which may not improbably have once formed the residence
and laboratory of Lucius Vallatinus, the Roman oculist, whose
name this curious relic
supplies. It consists of a
small cube of pale green
stone, two and three-fifth
inches in length, and engraved
on two sides as
in the annexed woodcut;
the letters being reversed for the purpose of stamping the
unguents or other medicaments retailed by its original possessor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 597px;">
<img src="images/image394.jpg" width="597" height="245" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The inscriptions admit of being extended thus on the one side:
<span class="smcap">L. VALLATINI EVODES AD CICATRICES ET ASPRITUDINES</span>, which may
be rendered&mdash;The evodes of Lucius Vallatinus for cicatrices and
granulations. The reverse, though in part somewhat more obscure,
reads: <span class="smcap">L. VALLATINI A PAL<sup>O</sup> CROCODES AD DIATHESES</span>&mdash;The crocodes,
or preparation of saffron, of L. Vallatinus of the Palatine School,(?)
for affections of the eyes.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Both the Euodes and the Crocodes are
prescriptions given by Galen, and occur on other medicine stamps.
Several examples have been found in England, and many in France
and Germany, supplying the names of their owners and the terms of
their preparations. Many of the latter indicate their chief use for
diseases of the eye, and hence they have most commonly received the
name of Roman oculists' stamps. No example, however, except the
one figured here, has ever occurred in Scotland; and amid legionary
inscriptions, military votive altars, and sepulchral tablets, it is peculiarly
interesting to stumble on this intelligent memento, restoring to
us the name of the old Roman physician who ministered to the
colonists of the Lothians the skill, and perchance also the charlatanry,
of the healing art.</p>

<p>A remarkable gold relic of a semicircular form was found in 1787
in a moss on the borders of Moffat parish, Annandale, near the track
of the Roman way. It measured from three to four inches in length,
but was evidently imperfect, and had on the exterior edge an orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>mental
raised rim, inscribed in characters perforated through the gold:
<span class="smcap">IOVI. AVG. VOT. XX</span>. An exceedingly beautiful bronze flagon, twelve
inches in height, plated with gold, and of undoubted Roman workmanship,
discovered in the bottom of a small burn, on the edge of an
extensive moss, in the parish of Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, is now in
the Hunterian Museum, and has been engraved in the Archæologia.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
A pair of patellæ, found near Frier's Carse, Dumfriesshire, in 1790,
one of them inscribed on the handle <span class="smcap">ANSIEPHARR</span>, are also engraved
and described in the Archæologia.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Two others are noticed by Ure,
which were found in a chambered tumulus, in the parish of Rutherglen,
and stamped with the name of <span class="smcap">CONGALLUS</span>. The handle of another
of the same type, the name on which is too indistinct to be deciphered,
was found at a depth of five feet in the Moss of Ballat,
Stirlingshire, in 1849, and is now in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries. In addition to these, among the MSS. in the library of
the Society, is a sketch of what appears to be justly described as
"one of the most elegant Roman cups ever discovered in Britain, of
the finest Corinthian brass, beautifully embellished with a dance of
the Bacchantæ in the centre, a wreath of vine leaves tastefully encircling
the neck in <i>alto relievo</i>, the whole highly finished. It was
found about nine feet under the surface of Lochar Moss, Dumfriesshire,
and long preserved in the family of a gentleman in that county,
but has now been lost sight of for some years." The drawing, which
is by Mr. W. S. Irvine, was forwarded to the Society through the present
Sir David Brewster in 1815, along with sketches of Roman altars
and other antiquities, and proposals for publishing a work on the
antiquities of what the author calls <i>Regnum Cambrense</i>. The drawings
are slight, and sadly out of perspective, but they furnish some
interesting materials relative to the Scottish Roman invasion, which
have escaped the notice of Stuart&mdash;the only writer who has treated
of the subject since their discovery. The vessel above described is
an exceedingly beautiful vase, with floriated handles, curving up into
birds' heads where they are attached at the lower ends to the vase.
Its dimensions are not given, and the sketch is unfortunately too imperfect
to be engraved.</p>

<p>Apart from the stations on the Antonine Wall and the fertile regions
of the Lothians, no district of Scotland has been so fruitful in remains
of Roman art and military skill as the country of the Selgovæ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>and especially Birrens, the supposed <span class="smcap">Blatum Bulgium</span> of Antoninus.
To the materials for the Scoto-Roman history of this province I am
fortunately able to make additions from various sources. The following
tablet, thus oddly located in the Morton MS., belongs to the district
of the Selgovæ,&mdash;"This inscription is in a house of Jockie Graham's
in Eskdale, fixed in a wall, set up, as appears by the Legio
Augusta Secunda, in memorial of the Emperor Hadrian;"</p>

<p class="center">IMP &middot; CÆS &middot; TRA &middot; HAD<br />
  RIANO &middot; AVG &middot;<br />
LEG II &middot; AVG &middot; F &middot;</p>

<p>The successor of Trajan, we know, visited our island soon after his
accession to the purple, but he was hastily summoned away to quell
an insurrection at another extremity of his unwieldy empire on the
banks of the Nile, and was glad to abandon the line where Agricola
had reared his forts for that finally adopted by Septimius Severus as
the northern limit of imperial sway. Camden mentions an inscription,
the counterpart of this, dug up at Netherby,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and Pennant describes
another nearly similar, (possibly indeed the Eskdale tablet,)
which he examined among the antiquities at Hoddam Castle, Dumfriesshire.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
All the inscriptions, however, transcribed by the latter
at Hoddam Castle, are understood, where not otherwise specified, to be
from the neighbouring station of Birrens, in which case the Eskdale
tablet forms an important addition to the traces of the Roman Emperor's
presence in Scotland. It is curious that neither Pennant, nor
Stuart in his more elaborate Caledonia Romana,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> makes any comment
on the singular discovery of a legionary dedication to the elder
Emperor Hadrian, found thus far within the transmural province
of Valentia. The legionary tablets of the Scottish Wall are its most
interesting relics. Notwithstanding the very great number of altars
and other Anglo-Roman inscriptions found along the line of the
southern wall, only two or three have borne the name of either of the
Emperors by whom it was erected, and none of them exactly correspond
to the Scottish legionary stones. So rare indeed are memorials
of Septimius Severus, even in the south, that Gordon characterizes
the discovery by Roger Gale of one bearing the name of that Emperor,
in the foundation of Hexham Church, Northumberland, as "a very
precious jewel of antiquity."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Eskdale for Annandale, we find ourselves within the interesting
locality which includes both the stations of Birrens and
Birrenswork Hill. Here have been discovered hypocausti, granaries,
altars; a ruined temple, with the full figure, as is supposed, of the
goddess Brigantia, inscribed with the name of <span class="smcap">AMANDUS</span> the architect,
who erected it in obedience to Imperial commands; the pedestal
and torso of a colossal statue of the god Mercury; a mutilated
statue of Fortune, the fruit of a vow in gratitude for restored
health, performed by a Prefect of one of the Tungrian cohorts; a
sepulchral tablet, dedicated by her mother to the shade of Pervica, a
Roman maiden who faded under our bleak northern skies; with
numerous other evidences of an important Roman colonia. A few of
the Birrens inscriptions and other antiquities belong to the earlier
years of the Roman presence in Scotland, but the greater number
appear to be clearly referrible to the later era of the province of Valentia,
subsequent to the retreat of the Emperor Septimius Severus.
This is proved by the debased style of art which stamps nearly all
the provincial Roman works of the third and fourth centuries. Confining
any detailed accounts, however, to such relics as have not been
previously described: in 1810 a beautiful altar, dedicated to Minerva,
was dug up at Birrens by Mr. Clow of Laud, and is described in Mr.
W. S. Irvine's MS. as serving (in 1815) as the pedestal to a sun-dial
in the garden of George Irving, Esq., at his seat of Burnfoot, near
Ecclefechan. It measures fifty inches in height by twenty-two inches
in breadth, and about nine inches in thickness, the back being as usual
roughly cut for standing against the wall. It presents an unusual
display of ornament, being decorated with vine leaves, birds, fishes,
and various architectural details. The inscription, which is in the
highest state of preservation, is&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">    DEAE<br />
  MINERVAE<br />
  COH II TVN<br />
    GRORVM<br />
  MIL EQ C L<br />
CVI PRÆEST CS L<br />
  AVSPEX PRÆF</p>

<p>which may be rendered: <span class="smcap">DEÆ MINERVÆ, COHORTIS SECUNDÆ TUNGRORUM,</span>
<span class="smcap">MILITIA EQUESTRIS CONSTANTINI LEGIONIS, CUI PRÆEST CAIUS LUCIUS AUSPEX</span>
<span class="smcap">PRÆFECTUS</span>. This altar remained a few years since, and I believe still
exists, as here described. But it is no solitary addition to the relics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
this second cohort of the Tungrians, whose memorials are even more
abundant than those of the Second Legion, Augusta, on the wall of Antoninus.
The Tungrians were among the first Roman legions to enter
Scotland, and appear to have been long stationed at Blatum Bulgium.
It was indeed to two Tungrian and three Batavian cohorts that
Agricola was principally indebted for his
victory over Galgacus. The valuable collection
of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharp, Esq., includes
three other altars, found about the
year 1812 at Birrens, all of them the fruits
of pious vows by the same Tungrian cohort.
The largest of these is a beautiful altar,
in the very finest state of preservation, of
which the woodcut conveys a good idea.
It measures fifty-five and a half inches
in height by thirty inches in greatest
breadth at top, and twenty and a quarter
inches across the inscribed front. The
inscription may be thus rendered: <span class="smcap">MARTI</span>
<span class="smcap">ET VICTORIÆ AUGUSTÆ CENTURIÆ TIRONUM</span>
<span class="smcap">MILITUM IN COHORTE SECUNDA TUNGRORUM,</span>
<span class="smcap">CUI PRÆEST SILVIUS AUSPEX, PRÆFECTUS.</span>
<span class="smcap">VOTUM SOLVERUNT LUBENTES MERITO</span>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/image398.jpg" width="287" height="579" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The second of these altars found at Birrens is a small but neat one,
measuring thirty-six inches high, by fourteen and five-eighth inches
in greatest breadth, thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">    DIB &middot; DE<br />
      AB &middot; Q<br />
      OMNB<br />
    FRVMENT<br />
IVS MIL C<sup>O</sup>H II<br />
    TVNGR &middot;</p>

<p>It may be read: <span class="smcap">DIIS DEABUSQUE OMNIBUS FRUMENTIUS MILES COHORTIS</span>
<span class="smcap">SECUNDÆ TUNGRORUM</span>. The third altar, which is of simpler and ruder
workmanship, measures forty-three and three-quarter inches in height,
by twenty-three and three-quarter inches in greatest breadth. It
appears to be dedicated by Pagus Vellaus to one of those obscure
local deities, apparently provincial names with Latin terminations,
which are more familiar than intelligible to the antiquary. It belongs
to a class of Romano-British relics peculiarly interesting, notwithstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>ing
the obscurity of their dedications, as the transition-link between
the Roman and British mythology. These altars of the adopted native
deities are generally rude and inferior in design, as if indicative of
their having their origin in the piety of some provincial legionary
subaltern. In the obscure gods and goddesses thus commemorated,
we most probably recognise the names of favourite local divinities of
the Romanized Britons, originating for the most part from the adoption
into the tolerant Pantheon of Rome of the older objects of native
superstitious reverence. Another altar found at Birrens is sacred to
the goddess Harimella; but the most comprehensive, as well, perhaps,
as the most interesting inscription of the whole class, is that on one
of the altars of Marcus Cocceius Firmus, found at Auchindavy, and
dedicated <span class="smcap">GENIO TERRAE BRITANNICAE</span>. With the exception of the
name, which adds a new one to our list of local divinities, the inscription
on the altar now referred to presents no unwonted difficulties.
It pertains, like the other Birrens altars, to the second
Tungrian cohort, and is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">DEAE RICAG<sup>M</sup><br />
BEDAE PAGV<sup>S</sup><br />
VELLAVS MILIT<br />
COH II TVN<sup>G</sup><br />
V S L M</p>

<p>Besides these interesting memorials of the Tungrians, Mr. Sharp
possesses a fourth altar from the same locality, which, though seen
by Pennant at Hoddam Castle, has been so inaccurately transcribed
by him, that it deserves a place among the unnoted Roman remains.
The inaccuracies, though great literally, are not of very essential importance,
except in the name assumed by the cohort, which he renders
<span class="smcap">NERVIORUM MILLE</span>. It measures forty-eight inches in height, by
twenty-two and three-eighth inches in breadth at top, and is thus
dedicated to the fickle goddess:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">FORTVNAE<br />
  COH I<br />
NERVANA<br />
GERMANOR<br />
    EQ</p>

<p>By means of the Irvine MS. in the Scottish Antiquaries' Library,
another altar pertaining to the same cohort is recovered, dedicated to
the Father of Olympus. It is a plain squared stone, measuring four
feet in height, two feet in breadth, and thirteen inches in thickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
without any ornament or moulding to relieve its bald form. It is
stated by Mr. Irvine to have been taken out of the heart of the wall
of the old church at Hoddam, when demolished, in 1815. The inscription
is complete, and clearly legible; the mark &#8734; is by no
means of rare occurrence, signifying a thousand. Several of the letters
in this, as well as in some of the previous examples, are joined for
the purpose of abbreviation, but without affecting the reading.</p>

<p class="center">      I O M<br />
COH &middot; I &middot; NERVANA<br />
GERMANOR &middot; &#8734; &middot; EQ<br />
CVI PRÆEST L FANI<br />
VS FELIX TRIB</p>

<p>To these altars there only remains to be added another dedicated
to Jove, derived from the same MS. It was dug up in 1814, in what
Mr. Irvine describes as a small vicinal camp on the banks of the
Kirtle, near Springkell, the elegant mansion of Sir J. H. Maxwell, Bart.
It is of simple form, being relieved only by a small moulding a little
way from the top. But the thuribulum is very carefully executed,
and on the right side is a præfericulum sculptured in relief. The inscription
is slightly mutilated: <span class="smcap">I.O.M ...NINVS..I FECIT.PP.</span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/image400.jpg" width="497" height="514" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But besides these relics of Pagan worship, another sepulchral tablet
preserves a contemporary memorial of fraternal affection such as pertains
exclusively to no creed or time. It is figured on a note of Mr.
Irvine's, which appears to have
accompanied the drawing of the
altar of Minerva, found at Birrens,
and may therefore be presumed,
like that dedicated to the
shade of Pervica, to have formed
another of the numerous Roman
remains which attest the importance
of the station of Blatum
Bulgium. It is thus dedicated to
the manes of Constantia, the infant
daughter of Philus Magnius,
who died at the age of one year, eight months, and nine days,&mdash;apparently
by her brother: assuming that the letters on the pediment
should be read, Frater fieri curavit.</p>

<p>These examples, while they serve to illustrate the traces of the
Roman invasion which are found in Scotland, furnish additional ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>terials
for its history. The circumstances under which some of them
have been discovered, and the fact that so many unedited inscriptions
should remain to be described, after the very recent researches of the
author of the Caledonia Romana, may suffice to shew how many more
such relics must have disappeared from time to time, without an
opportunity being afforded to the archæologist of noting their pregnant
records.</p>

<p>To these may be added the following meagre list of Potters' Stamps,&mdash;all
that I have been able to recover pertaining to Roman Scotland.
This, however, arises from no paucity of materials. Mr. C. K. Sharp
informs me that in his early years he remembers to have seen large
accumulations of broken Samian ware and other Roman pottery dug
up at Birrenswork. The same is also known to have occurred both
at Inveresk and Cramond; and during the progress of construction
of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1841, a mass of debris
about twelve feet deep was cut through on the site of the Castlecary
Fort, which led to the exposure of a quantity of broken pottery, including
some very fine fragments of embossed Samian ware, now in
the possession of the Earl of Zetland, the owner of the ground. Had
the person entrusted by the noble proprietor to take care of any relics
that might be discovered, been sufficiently aware of the interest now
attached to the potters' stamps, a large addition to the Scottish list
would probably have been the result. As it was, however, he only
served effectually to prevent this being accomplished. My friend, Mr.
John Buchanan, a zealous Scottish antiquary, who visited Castlecary
for the purpose, was prohibited from touching anything within the
charmed circle; and, accordingly, these evidences of Roman art are
mostly buried below the railway embankment, for rediscovery by other
generations, when railway viaducts shall be as obsolete relics as Roman
vallums now are. Within the area of the station a neatly cut centurial
inscription was discovered, and is now preserved by the Earl of Zetland.
It bears the inscription,&mdash;<span class="smcap">COHORTIS SEXTÆ CENTURIA ANTONII</span>
<span class="smcap">ARATI</span>, thus abbreviated:</p>

<p class="center">  CHO VI<br />
&#8579; ANTO<br />
  ARATI.</p>

<p>It is only very recently, even in England, that the names of the
potters stamped on Roman fictile ware, have attracted much attention
or been carefully recorded. Through the exertions of Mr. Charles
Roach Smith and other zealous archæologists, we are now in posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>sion
of ample means for comparing new discoveries with the potters'
stamps of London, Colchester, and York; but no collection of Scoto-Roman
pottery exists, so far as I am aware, with the exception of the
few specimens in the Museum of Scottish Antiquaries. The following
<i>apology</i> for a Scottish list must therefore meanwhile suffice. It may
perhaps form the nucleus of a more ample one at a subsequent period,
by which to enable us to test the question of native or foreign manufacture,
and to trace out the sources from whence the Roman colonists
of Britain imported their finer fictile wares. The Scottish Museum
furnishes a few curious specimens from Castlecary, some of which are
given here in fac-simile. The first occurs on fine black ware, and looks
like the imperfect attempt of some native or provincial potter to imitate
a Roman stamp which he probably could not read. The second
and third may be most fitly described as cuneiform. The larger of
the two is on thin unglazed red ware. The fourth is on a patera of
fine glazed Samian ware, and furnishes a good example of the mode of
joining the letters together, with which English antiquaries are familiar,
not only on the pottery, but also on the altars and inscribed tablets
of the Anglo-Roman period. All these impressions are clear and
distinct, so that their peculiarities are designed. Two of the other
Castlecary stamps are furnished me by Mr. Buchanan, and the remainder
are in my own possession, having been picked up in the neighbourhood
of the railway embankment since its completion. For those
from Newstead I am chiefly indebted to Dr. J. A. Smith.</p>

<p>A handle of a Scoto-Roman amphora in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries, the exact locality of the discovery of which is unknown,
is stamped with the letters M. P. F. The Roman fictilia in
the same collection also include terra cotta lamps from several Scottish
localities. One of singular type, in the form of a broad leaf, with
the veins strongly marked in relief, was found at Chester Knowes, near
Chirnside, Berwickshire, the site as is believed of a temporary camp.
Another is from Castlecary, and a third from Birrens. Besides these,
various urns, lachrymatories, fragments of mortaria, amphoræ, and
Samian, and other wares, all suffice to shew the correspondence of the
Roman fictile ware of Scotland and England.</p>

<p>Such are some of the traces of the Roman occupation of Scotland.
If we believe the direct statements of the few classic historians who
have thought our northern region worthy of notice, the natives were
in a state of extreme degradation and barbarism. Yet from the same
authors we are able to discover that these barbarians fought in chariots,
were armed with swords, lances, bucklers, and poniards, and were capable
of offering the most formidable resistance to the veteran legions.
Still more, we find that the Caledonians never settled down either in
contented peace or in passive despair under the Roman yoke. Experience
of the legions did not intimidate them; and at length Septimius
Severus, one of the ablest of the Roman emperors, was compelled to
employ the arts of the diplomatist rather than of the soldier ere he
abandoned them once more to their wild freedom. We may indeed
question if this remote region could be worth the labour of conquest;
but when once occupied we see in the remains of Roman works
abundant reasons why the conquerors should wish to retain it. Our
chief inquiry however is, to what extent did this brief and partial
Roman occupation affect the native manners and arts? The answer,
I think, must be, that its influence was slight, partial, and transitory.
Like an unwonted tide, the flood of Roman invasion swept beyond
its natural limits, disturbing and unsettling many things long unaffected
by change. But the tide ebbed as rapidly as it had flowed,
and at most only helped to prepare the soil for a new growth. Neither
the manners, the faith, nor the social habits of these foreign occupants
of the country could be at all acceptable to the natives, though
their superior arts and military skill would not fail to be appreciated,
and must have been turned to good account. As, however, we have
traced earlier arts and discoveries passing onward from the south to
the tribes of the north, and effectually revolutionizing all their pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>mitive
habits: so, too, the increasing civilisation of the Anglo-Roman
provinces must have extended its fruits beyond the wall of
Severus, and effected a more immediate and rapid change than the
influence of the same Roman civilisation is seen to have done on
Ireland or Denmark, where no legionary invaders ever constructed
their intrenchments or established their colonies.</p>

<p>By far the most remarkable native structure which appears to be
traceable to the influence and example of Roman arts is the "Deil's
Dike," a vast rampart of earth and stone strengthened by a fosse,
which passes across many miles of country, through Galloway and
Nithsdale. This singular British vallum has excited much less attention
than its magnitude and great extent seem to demand. It has
been traced through a much larger district of country than the whole
length of the Antonine Wall; and though it lacks the historic interest
of that structure, and the valuable legionary inscriptions found
along its line, it is nevertheless a remarkable evidence of combined
action and primitive engineering skill. Mr. Joseph Train remarks of
it,&mdash;"As it passes from Torregan to Dranandow, it runs through a
bog, and is only perceptible by the heather growing long and close on
the top of it; whereas, on each side the soil only produces rushes and
moss. Near the centre of the bog I caused the peat to be cleared
away close to the dike, and thereby found the foundation to be several
feet below the surface, which appeared to me a sure indication of its
great antiquity." This ancient wall measures eight feet broad at the
base, and is mostly built of rough unhewn blocks of moorstone or
trap. In districts where stone is more inaccessible it is constructed
of stones mixed with earth and clay, and at some few points it is entirely
of earth. It has been strengthened at intervals with fortified
stations, like the Roman walls from which its model is supposed to be
derived. One of these, on the height above Glendochart, is a circular
fort 190 yards in diameter. Another fort is situated on a well-chosen,
commanding height, called the Hill of Ochiltree, on the east side of
Loch Maberrie. The fosse, which is still traceable along a great part
of the wall, is on its north side, from whence we are justified in inferring
that the vallum was reared by the natives of the southern
districts. It is, of course, impossible to assign the age or the builders
of this ancient structure with absolute certainty. History is utterly
silent on the subject; and it is a fact well worthy of note, in reference
to previous remarks on the possibility of many noteworthy deeds
having passed unchronicled to oblivion, that everything connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
with this defensive erection is involved in the darkest obscurity. The
very name which ascribes its origin to the Master Fiend shews how
completely tradition has lost every clue to its builders. Yet the civilisation
which led to such combined exertion as was needed both for
the erection and defence of such an extent of wall must have been
considerable. History has doubtless burdened itself with the charge
of many meaner themes. The correspondence of the general design
to the two Roman walls seems very clearly to point to its erection
by the southern Britons after the departure of the Romans, when
we know that they frequently suffered from inroads of the northern
tribes. The circular forts along the line of the Deil's Dike also furnish
a curious link connecting it at once with the older Roman and
native military works, while they present a striking contrast to the
camps and wall stations of the Roman legionaries.</p>

<p>Cæsar refers to the Britons in his time as using imported bronze.
But he had no personal knowledge of the south-western districts of
England, where copper and tin had been wrought for ages prior to the
Roman invasion. Whether iron was manufactured in Britain before
the Roman Invasion it is now perhaps impossible to ascertain, but the
familiarity of the Romans with the mineral wealth of England at an
early period gives some probability to the supposition that they found
native workings of iron and lead as well as of tin and copper. Tacitus
refers in general terms to the metallic wealth of Britain; Pliny alludes
to the smelting of iron; and Solinus speaks of its use in the manufacture
of weapons and agricultural implements. But whether the
Romans originated, or only followed up the native workings, in mining
for lead and iron, it is unquestionable that they gave a new impetus
to the application of the metals to economic purposes. Roman pottery
and glass, coins of Nero, Vespasian, and Diocletian, and other undoubted
evidences of a Roman origin, have been discovered among
the accumulated beds of scoriæ and other refuse of ancient forges in
Sussex. Similar traces of iron-foundries accompanied with Roman
coins have been observed near the wall of Hadrian, in Yorkshire and
other counties. Two altars found at different times, the last at Benwell,
in Northumberland, dedicated to Jupiter Dolichenus, the protector
of iron-works, add still further evidence of the extent to which
this useful metal was wrought during the Anglo-Roman period.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>The forest of Dean also is familiar to English archæologists for its extensive
mines and shafts, its beds of scoriæ, and other remains of ancient
forges, among which have been found unquestionable traces of
the Roman presence. Similar works are not to be looked for in Scotland,
where no indisputable traces have yet been detected even of
the working of the superficial clay. Many remains of ancient forges
are, however, known in various districts both to the north and south
of the Antonine Wall, though generally unaccompanied by relics
which can enable us to assign them unhesitatingly to any precise
period. The traces of an extensive iron forge are still obvious on
the "Fir Isle," a peninsular promontory on the Carlinwark Loch,
Kirkcudbrightshire, a locality peculiarly rich in its stores of archæological
relics, including even the rude primitive canoes and
other records of the primeval era. During the construction of the
great military road through the same district, a large mound was
levelled at a place called "Buchan's Croft, near the three thorns of
the Carlinwark," which proved to be a mass of scoriæ and cinders,
such as are generally left from a forge. This the ancient traditions
of Galloway assign to a comparatively recent date, marking
it as the spot where the famed Scottish cannon Mons Meg was manufactured
in the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Similar remains in the Roman
districts of Lanarkshire are unhesitatingly attributed, in the Old Statistical
Account of the parish of Dalziel, to operations of the Roman
colonists:&mdash;"The great Roman highway, commonly called Watling
Street, went along the summit of this parish from east to west, but
its course is now much defaced by modern improvements. In one
place, however, near the centre of that parish, it has been preserved
entire, so as to point out the line to after times; the cross stone, the
emblem of the baron's jurisdiction, being placed upon it, and that
fenced by a large clump of trees planted around. At this place lies
a large heap of the cinders of the Roman forges still untouched."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>In many of the uncultivated districts of Scotland iron ore occurs
in the forms already noted as the most easily adapted for conversion
into metal; and it is by no means improbable that such sources may
have supplied it to the Celtic metallurgists, long before they had
learned the difficult processes requisite for converting the native iron-stone
into metal. Whencesoever the art was derived, numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>Highland traditions and even the names of particular localities point
to the excellency of the ancient Celtic smiths. In Blair-Atholl, for
example, a district abounding with cairns and other primitive memorials,
is <i>Dail-na-Cardoch</i>&mdash;the dale of the smith's shop, or rather
of the iron work; and <i>Dail-na-mein</i>&mdash;the dale of the mineral.
"Near these," says the old Statist of the parish of Blair-Atholl,
"and along the side of the hill, down to Blair, are still to be seen
the holes wherein they smelted the iron ore." Similar pits scattered
over the northern moors are described as the kilns in which
peats were charred for smelting. "There is still to be seen in
Glenturret," says Logan in his Scottish Gael, "a shieling called
Renna Cardick&mdash;the smith's dwelling&mdash;with the ruins of houses, heaps
of ashes, and other indications of an iron manufactory. Old poems
mention it as a work where the metal, of which swords and other
arms were made some miles lower down the valley, was prepared.
In Sutherland also are distinct marks of the smelting and working
of iron with fires of wood."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> In Islay is still shewn the spot where
stood the forge of its once celebrated smiths, and the rocks from
whence the iron was dug which they fabricated into the renowned
"Lann-Ila," or Islay blades.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In the <i>Sean Dana le Oisian</i> also occurs
the elaborated poetic description of the ancient bow and quiver,
concluding <i>'S ceann o'n cheard Mac Pheidearain</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, and the head of
the arrow from the smith MacPhedran. Among the curious relics preserved
in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries is the rude pair of
iron forge-tongs figured above. They measure thirty and a half inches
in length in their present imperfect state, and are described in the
minutes of the Society as having been discovered buried under the
steep bank of a river in Glenorchy, thirty feet below the surface.
It is farther added, in the neighbourhood of the spot great quantities
of charcoal were found, and other indications that anciently there
had been a smelting work there, though no trace of it now exists in
the history or traditions of the country.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

STRONGHOLDS.</h3>


<p>Next to the sepulchral monuments and the temples of remote
ages, the fortifications frequently furnish the most durable and
characteristic evidences of skill, and of the civilisation of the era to
which they belong. In the Great Valley of the Mississippi, after
Anglo-Saxon colonists have for upwards of two centuries been effecting
settlements on the soil of the Red Indian, and obliterating every
trace of him by their more enduring arts, the burial mounds and the
forts of a race still older than the Red Indian remain to attest the
pre-existence of civilisation in the American continent. Here, too,
where for nine centuries at least, we can find authentic records of
builders, sculptors, ecclesiastical architects, and military engineers,
fashioning rude materials into goodly fabrics, of which traces are
still discernible: we also can discover the wrecks of older structures
reared in those dim and remote eras, into the secrets of which we
long to penetrate. "How cold is all history, how lifeless all imagery,
compared to that which the living nation writes, and the uncorrupted
marble bears! How many pages of doubtful record might we not
often spare, for a few stones left one upon another! The ambition
of the old Babel-builders was well directed for this world. There are
but two strong conquerors of the forgetfulness of men, Poetry and
Architecture; and the latter in some sort includes the former, and is
mightier in its reality. It is well to have not only what men have
thought and felt, but what their hands have handled, and their
strength wrought, and their eyes beheld all the days of their life.
The age of Homer is surrounded with darkness, his very personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
with doubt. Not so that of Pericles: and the day is coming when
we shall confess that we have learned more of Greece out of the
crumbled fragments of her sculpture, than even from her sweet
singers or soldier historians."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The Scottish "Caterthun" is no
Athenian Acropolis, and our monolithic temples, though not ineloquent
memorials of their builders, must rank with the primeval
cyclopean structures of Greece, and not with her Parthenon or
Colonna. But the aboriginal strongholds, though mostly of a sufficiently
rude and primitive character, must not be overlooked in
reviewing those "conquerors of the forgetfulness of men." The construction
of offensive and defensive weapons is one of the earliest
evidences afforded by man, in a savage state, of that intelligence and
design by which he is distinguished from the brutes. Domestic and
social relationships follow, from whence spring society, ranks, laws,
and all the primary elements of civilisation. Among the first indications
of such progress is the union for mutual defence, and the erection
of strongholds for the safety of the community and the protection
of property when threatened by invading foes. Herein lie the essential
rudiments of a commonwealth, when the weal of the community
and of its individual members have been recognised as the same.</p>

<p>A very slight review of the more simple class of British hill-forts
will suffice, since we fortunately possess, in many of the contemporary
records already described, more precise and definite history than they
can now yield. It is for this reason that all notice of the aboriginal
strongholds has been reserved till now, though it cannot admit of
doubt that some of the simplest of them are contemporary with the
pit-dwellings of the Stone Period, while others manifest such improvements
as seem best to accord with the arts and weapons of the
Archaic era which succeeded. Of these we have the circumscribed
mote-hill or earthen-mound, steeply escarped, and with the remains
of its little vallum of earth surmounted originally by the stronger
palisades for which the neighbouring forest supplied abundant material.
Nearly akin to these are the small circular forts of earth and
loose stones which still crown the summits of so many Scottish hills;
their lofty sites having secured them from the inroads of the agriculturist,
while his aggressive ploughshare has obliterated all traces of
the far more skilfully constructed Roman camp and military road
which once occupied the neighbouring valleys. Within the area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
some of these, or scattered about their neighbourhood, flint arrows
and other primitive weapons have been frequently found, accompanied
occasionally by more valuable relics. On removing, in 1830,
the rich black mould nearly filling the trenches of three such forts,
the remains of which still crown the ridge of a rising ground above
the valley of Dalrymple, Ayrshire, human skulls and bones, deer's
horns, and a horn-lance or spear-head of primitive type, were discovered.
Similar records of the aboriginal fort-builders must no
doubt frequently be turned up in the course of agricultural operations:
but they can only tell us what is already obvious, that this
class of strongholds, or duns, as they are locally termed, pertain to a
people whose arts were still in their infancy. Some, however, of
the small hill-forts must be regarded as the mere temporary lodge-ments
of British outposts, in times of actual open war. Of this class
probably are the earth-works on the summit of Birrenswork Hill, in
Annandale, while the more extensive intrenchments of the Roman
legions occupy the level areas at its base. Similar works are also to
be met with in the Western Highlands. At Knoc Scalbert, near
Campbelton, Argyleshire, is a fort of larger size and more complicated
design, covering an area of about fifty paces in diameter; but the
neighbouring heights retain the traces of the smaller outpost stations,
indicative, when thus found in combination, of considerable skill and
warlike strategy. Such also may be presumed to be the origin of
these small hill-forts, where we trace a line of them on a series of successive
heights, as may be seen on the Lammermoors and in other
Scottish districts, and is especially noteworthy along the southern
slopes of the Kilsyth and Campsie hills, immediately to the north of
the great Roman wall. These are obviously the outposts of the
hardy Caledonian, from whence he watched his opportunity for some
sudden foray or midnight surprise of the garrisons occupying the
stations along the wall, and which he maintained with such persevering
success that the Roman conquerors had at length to give
way, and to fix the northern limits of empire on the older line of
Hadrian, between the Solway and the Tyne.</p>

<p>The circular British forts or camps surmounting the heights of
Galloway and the Lothians, and more or less common in nearly every
district of Scotland, generally occupy an area of from three hundred
to four hundred feet in diameter, and are inclosed with ramparts
of earth and stone, or occasionally entirely of loose heaps of stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
which have lost through time every trace of any definite form of
masonry they no doubt once possessed. But the subject has already
been treated of with ample details in Chalmers' Caledonia;<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and little
that is worth recording can be added to his careful researches. Roy
also includes the most important of these native strongholds in his
"Military Antiquities," superadding to his descriptions, plans and
sections, by which a very perfect idea can be formed of their original
design. These include Wood Castle, a very remarkable circular fort
near Lochmaben, in Annandale,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> which General Roy describes as a
Roman post, though it differs in every possible feature from any known
example of Roman castrametation. That it is a British stronghold
is not now likely to be called in question. It bears, indeed, a singularly
close affinity to the circular earth-works which so frequently
accompany the Scottish monolithic circles. Others of the supposed
Roman forts bear scarcely less conclusive marks of native workmanship,
as the intrenched post on Inch Stuthill, near the Tay, (<i>Plate</i>
XVIII.;) Liddell-Moat, near the junction of the Liddel with the Esk,
(<i>Plate</i> XXIII.;) Castle Over, situated on a high point of land, formed
by the junction of the Black and White Esks, (<i>Plate</i> XXVI.) supposed
by Roy to be the Roman Uxellum; and Burgh-Head, on the
Murray Frith, (<i>Plate</i> XXXIII.) which he unhesitatingly assigns as
the Ultima Pteroton of Richard of Cirencester, and the Alata Castra
of Ptolemy. All of these bear a curious general resemblance to some
of the aboriginal forts of the Mississippi Valley; thus affording, under
another aspect, evidence of the mind of man operating in the same way
when placed in similar circumstances, and with a force not perhaps
greatly differing from the unerring instincts of the lower animals.
The last example, that of Burgh-Head, possibly includes some remains
of Roman works. The straight wall and rounded angles, so characteristic
of the legionary earth-works, are still discernible, and were probably
much more obvious when General Roy explored the fort; but
its character is that of a British fort, and its site, on a promontory
nearly inclosed by the sea, is opposed to the practice of the Romans
in the choice of an encampment. The remarkable general correspondence
of the Scottish "Deil's Dike," described in the last chapter, to
the Scoto and Anglo-Roman walls, proves that the native Britons
were not slow to avail themselves of the superior engineering skill
of the invaders, displayed in military works of more importance than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>the mere rectangular vallum.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The fortifications here specified are
not, however, to be classed with the simple circular hill-forts first
noted, wherein we trace the mere rudimentary efforts of a people in
the infancy of the arts. They display equal skill in the choice of site,
and in the elaborate adaptation of their earth-works to the natural
features of the ground. Though undoubtedly of native workmanship
many of these are not improbably contemporary erections thrown up
by the native Caledonian to withstand the encroachments of the
Roman invader.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable British fort to the north of the Tweed, if
not indeed in the whole island, is that which crowns the summit of
Caterthun, looking across the valley of Strathmore. Two neighbouring
heights are occupied with British forts. The larger of these, called
the White Caterthun, from the colour of its walls, is an elaborate,
skilfully constructed stronghold, which must have formed a place of
great strength when held by a hardy and well-armed native garrison.
It is of an oval form, inclosing an inner area of four hundred and
thirty-six feet in length, by two hundred feet in breadth. But this
only constitutes what may be regarded as the citadel. Beyond it a
succession of ramparts and ditches surround the height at lower elevations,
including a much larger area, and affording scope for a more
numerous body of defenders. The hollow is still visible, though now
nearly filled up, which was once the well of the fort, and probably this
strength was maintained as a rendezvous and place of temporary retreat
for the entire population of the surrounding district. The
White Caterthun has been repeatedly engraved, and its construction
and details will be best understood by a reference to the plans and
sections in Roy's Military Antiquities.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The Brown Caterthun, which
crowns another hill about a mile to the north, is also a specimen of
ingenious native fortification. Its ramparts are nearly circular, and
a series of concentric intrenchments extend down the slopes of the
height.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Both of these native military works have been constructed
with immense labour. The astonishing dimensions of the rampart of
the former, composed of an accumulation of large loose stones, upwards
of a hundred feet thick at the base, and fully twenty-five feet thick at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>the top, with its extensive lower earth-works and ditches, excite surprise
and wonder in the mind of every observer. General Roy remarks after
a careful survey of it,&mdash;"The vast labour it must have cost to amass
so incredible a quantity of stones, and carry them to such a height,
surpasses all description."</p>

<p>Another remarkable hill-fort of the same class is at the Barmekyn
of Echt, in Aberdeenshire; and at Dundalaiv, on an unusually steep
and rugged height in Glenshiora, Badenoch, is one smaller, but perhaps
more striking, from the superior masonry of its walls. These are from
twelve to fourteen feet in thickness, and being built of thin flat schistose
slate, the walls remain in parts fully fourteen feet high, and apparently
as perfect as when first erected. The inclosed area of this ancient
fortress also contains a well, and considerable ingenuity has been shewn
in strengthening the weaker points of the position. Altogether, it is
the most perfect relic of a British stronghold of the class that I know
of in Scotland.</p>

<p>The so-called "Vitrified Forts" of Scotland which have been the
subject of so many ingenious and baseless theories, form another
interesting class of native works. Attention was first drawn to
them by Mr. John Williams, in his "Account of some remarkable
Ancient Ruins, lately discovered in the Highlands and northern parts
of Scotland," published in 1777. Mr. Williams had been employed by
the trustees of the Scottish estates forfeited in the last rebellion, to
superintend some operations in his capacity of a civil engineer, and in
the course of this he for the first time investigated the singular remains
to which he gave the name of Vitrified Forts. So entirely new
was the discovery that it was generally received at first as an extravagant
fiction, and no London publisher could be persuaded to undertake
the publication of Mr. Williams's Account. His facts, however,
proved indisputable, and theorists thereupon undertook to combat his
conclusions, and to assign to the supposed forts a volcanic origin.
The appearance of some of the most remarkable of these works is
well calculated to sustain such a theory. The fortified area on the
Top-o-Noth, near the village of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, for example,&mdash;one
of the most remarkable specimens of a vitrified fort in Scotland,&mdash;could
not be more accurately described than by comparing it to the
crater of an extinct volcano.</p>

<p>Since the first announcement of Mr. Williams's remarkable discovery
there has been no lack of observation or controversy on the sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>ject,
though not always with very satisfactory results. In 1825 the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland directed special attention to it, and
the results of a series of careful investigations are published in the
fourth volume of the Archæologia Scotica, made chiefly under the
direction of the late Dr. Samuel Hibbert, one of the secretaries of the
Society, and further qualified for the duty as an experienced practical
geologist. The fruit of these investigations may be thus stated:&mdash;Dr.
Hibbert arrives at the conclusion that the vitrification is an incidental
and not a designed effect,&mdash;having formed no part of the
process of erection of the forts or cairns on which it is now traceable,
but resulting accidentally from the frequent kindling of beacon-fires
as the signals of war or invasion, as well as from bonfires which
formed a part of festive or religious rejoicings; and indeed from
numerous independent causes, probably no less widely dissimilar in
dates than in origination. The nature of the sites, also, where vitrification
has been detected proves that it is by no means confined to fortified
positions; nor when it does occur on such is it generally found
diffused throughout the ramparts of stone, or even restricted to their
limits. Dr. Hibbert accordingly rejects the name of <i>vitrified fort</i> for
the more comprehensive and untheoretical one of <i>vitrified site</i>, as
most descriptive of remains which appear to include small inclosures
for the protection of beacon-fires; sites of bonfires periodically lighted
at the ancient places of rendezvous for tribes or clans; and hearths
of fort-beacons and signal-fires, occasionally occupying not the ramparts
but the ditch.</p>

<p>The only argument which tends to throw any doubt on the result of
Dr. Hibbert's conclusions is that of Dr. Macculloch,&mdash;a shrewd observer,
little inclined generally to extend toleration to any antiquarian
hobbies but his own,&mdash;who affirms, that in situations where the most
accessible materials for constructing a stone fort are such as are incapable
of being vitrified, suitable materials have been selected and
brought with considerable labour from a distance.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But the evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>of design in the choice of such materials is by no means apparent.
The examples referred to by Dr. Macculloch only confirm the fact,
already familiar to the chemist and geologist, that there are very
few districts in Scotland where rocks do not occur capable of being
more or less vitrified. This subject is fully illustrated by an interesting
series of experiments carried on by Sir James Hall, towards
the close of last century, with a view to test some of the geological
theories in reference to the igneous formation of rocks, which then
furnished a fertile theme of controversy between the disciples of
Werner and Hutton.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> All the varieties of trap are so peculiarly susceptible
of fusion, that they have been recently selected as the most efficient
and economical flux in the smelting of copper ores. I am indebted
to Dr. Francis Hay Thomson, the inventor and patentee of the
ingenious application of the common rocks to this novel purpose, for
communicating to me the results of his experiments. His invention
chiefly consists in "the application of what are commonly called
whinstones, and of other stones similar to whinstone&mdash;such as trap,
basalt, sienite, and the like, being fusible silicates, as a flux in the
smelting of copper ores." He has found all these materials capable
of easy and complete fusion in a reverberatory furnace; but a much
more moderate degree of heat would suffice to produce the conglomerated
masses usually found on vitrified sites, where the larger
stones are merely inclosed and cemented together by the fused
matter. In reply to inquiries as to the probable effect of bale-fires
kept blazing repeatedly on the same ramparts or heaps of stones,
where a gradual accumulation of ashes from the burning pile must fill
up the intervening spaces, and supply a flux capable of combining for
the ultimate fusion of the whole, Dr. Thomson remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Granite is <i>per se</i> very infusible; that of Aberdeen almost entirely so, in consequence
of the presence of an overplus of silica. Sandstone is <i>per se</i> quite infusible,
being almost entirely silica. Your supposition may, however, be correct,
for the addition of the alkali produced from the wood-ashes would much assist the
fusion of all kinds of stone that might be used in building these forts. Whinstone
contains at least four per cent. of pure soda, fifteen of iron, and from twelve to
twenty of lime. All these form a most fusible mixture, and the silica present is
only in such proportion as is necessary for vitrification. Limestone is of itself not
fusible except at a very high temperature; but the addition of either iron or
soda with silica renders it at once vitreous. Although I am not certain as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>exact degrees of heat requisite for the fusion of these materials, I may mention
that, in an ordinary reverberatory furnace, I have fused five cwt. of whinstone in
one hour and a half, the product being a dark mass similar to bottle-glass; and I
have no doubt, were proper precautions taken, that large slabs might easily be
moulded for building purposes."</p></div>

<p>The degree of heat attainable in a reverberatory furnace manifestly
greatly exceeds any temperature that could be produced by an exposed
fire of wood; but the usual appearance of the vitrified masses
found on the sites of forts or beacon-hills is such as proves them to
be the product of a more moderate heat. The larger pieces are not
fused into a homogeneous mass, but blocks of trap, granite, and sandstone,
or occasionally all three in juxtaposition, are enveloped in a
vitrified coating of irregular thickness, and bound into a solid piece
by this extraneous substance. The alkali supplied by wood-ashes is
abundantly sufficient to produce such a result. Carbonate of potash
in contact with trap will readily melt at a red heat, and has a power of
uniting with the constituents of the trap to form a fusible compound
which hardens into glass in cooling. Fire-clay, which is altogether
infusible, and less liable to be affected by heat than most of the known
natural rocks, is employed on this account in making the chemists'
crucibles; but if an alkali is melted in a fire-clay crucible, it forms a
vitreous covering on the surface, and where large quantities are used
even goes through the crucible. This is a fact familiar to the chemist,
and so impossible is it to keep fused alkalis in contact with silicates,
that only crucibles of platina or silver can be used for the analysis
of silicious minerals. In this way even sandstone, though <i>per se</i>
infusible, is perfectly capable of vitrification, and indeed is, under
certain circumstances, peculiarly susceptible of it, as its great porosity
admits of the ready absorption of the melted alkali.</p>

<p>This susceptibility of the degree of fusion usually observable on
vitrified sites, which trap and others of the common rocks of Scotland
possess, has long been recognised by able chemists; and when it is
taken into consideration along with the very diversified and dissimilar
circumstances under which vitrification has been observed, the conclusion
seems inevitable, that it is an incidental and not a designed
result of the application of fire. But neither the interest nor the importance
of this inquiry is exhausted when we have established the
undesigned origin of vitrified sites. The question still remains,&mdash;Are
they peculiar to Scotland? because, even if we reject the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
that the cementing of stone buildings by means of fire is among the
<i>artes deperditæ Scotiæ</i>, still the discovery of so many vitrified sites
in nearly every district of Scotland, would seem to indicate the practice
of peculiar customs and observances during those early centuries
in which the primeval forests furnished an unlimited supply of fuel.
It is at all times a precarious and unsatisfactory basis of argument
which depends chiefly on the absence of contrary evidence. Nevertheless
it is worthy of some note, that although upwards of seventy
years have elapsed since Mr. Williams published his account of vitrified
forts, no single example, so far as I am aware, has been discovered
south of the Tweed.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> This cannot be ascribed to the subject
being one of mere local or temporary interest. It has excited much
controversy, not only among English antiquaries, but among the
students of various kindred sciences; and while the geological features
of some districts preclude the possible existence of such structures,
it will, I think, involve very important conclusions as to the
peculiar customs of the early Caledonians, if it be recognised as an
established fact, that neither in the Welsh Highlands nor in the
stone districts of England, are any traces of vitrified forts or sites
visible. It has been the fashion of late years to give the whole question
the go-by in very summary terms as one that has already commanded
undue notice. Such, however, is a more convenient than
satisfactory mode of dealing with the inquiry. Dr. Hibbert has appended
to his "Observations on Vitrified Forts," a list of forty-four
sites already noted, extending over twelve Scottish counties, including
the most northern and the most southern districts of the kingdom.
To these others have since been added, both north and south, in the
Orkney Islands, and in the vicinity of Jedburgh, near the English
border. It will suffice, meanwhile, to note these facts, in the hope
that English Archæologists may, on fitting occasion, seek a reply to the
inquiries which they involve:&mdash;Were the southern Britons, whether
Celtic or Saxon, or the intruding Scandinavians or Gauls, wont to
kindle bayle or beacon-fires on cairns, forts, or elevated sites, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>such frequency as to leave similar traces to those which are so common
in Scotland? Or must we infer that these abundant remains are the
result of ancient rites and customs peculiar to the races of the northern
kingdom?</p>

<p>Dr. Hibbert has already invited the investigations of Scandinavian
Archæologists, with a like view, anticipating, from the notices of Olaus
Magnus, Snorro, and others, that vitrified sites should be found on
the mountain tops in Norwegian provinces. Nineteen years have
elapsed since Scottish Antiquaries appealed to those of Scandinavia for
a reply. They have not been unmindful of the interests of archæological
science in the interval, but still we wait in the uncertain negative
which their silence furnishes; casting, meanwhile, some curious
thoughts backward on the old Scottish festival of Beltane, and its
apparent affinity to the rites of the Assyrian Baal.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>To attempt to assign a date for these primitive forts or vitrified
sites would be manifest folly, but even to apportion them to one or
more of those less definite periods is difficult. Some of them doubtless
pertain to the earliest era of combined action, of which they would
form one of the first results, while others may belong to a comparatively
recent period; and, in particular, such border sites as those of
Cowdenknowes and Howden Moor<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> perchance date no farther back
than to those eventful times of watch and ward on the Scottish borders,
quaintly referred to in the Act of James the Second's Parliament,
in 1455, "for bailes making" to warn of the approach of the Southron
foe: "Ane baile is warning of their cumming, quhat power that ever
they bie of; twa bailes togidder at anis, they are cumming indeed;
four bailes, ilk ane beside uther, and all at anis as foure candelles,
suithfast knawledge that they ar of great power and meanis far."</p>

<p>The duns and vitrified forts of Scotland have long been the subject
of observation and controversy; but there is another class of defensive
earth-works observable in various Scottish districts, which, so far as I
am aware, have not yet attracted the notice of the antiquary, though
sufficiently familiar to rustic observers. These consist of artificial
trenches, generally dug in the side of a hill, and obviously designed
for the hasty concealment of cattle from predatory bands of marauders,
though in some cases tradition associates them with more remarkable
events. One, for example, of considerable extent, situated between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>Kintore and Inverury, in Aberdeenshire, is popularly known as <i>Bruce's</i>
<i>Howe</i>, from an old tradition that it had afforded the means of concealment
to a party of Robert the Bruce's army before the battle of
Inverury. Its depth, like that of most others, is about eight feet,
affording effective shelter and concealment both to men and horses.
Another of these artificial trenches has been cut out of the side of a
hill, near its summit, on the farm of Altyre, parish of Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire.
It is capable of containing about an hundred men,
while a person concealed in it can see to a considerable distance, in
the two principal directions of approach, without being observed.
From the convenient retreat it afforded to the persecuted Covenanters
in the time of Charles II., it still bears the name of the <i>Whig Hole</i>.
A larger trench of the same kind exists along the side of a steep hill
forming one of the range of Scuir-na-fion in Glencoe. This has been
constructed with considerable skill, the trench running parallel with
the range of hills, and opening at its west end in a gully formed by a
small mountain stream, which joins the river Coe somewhat farther
down. From a distance, or from any lower part of the Glen, the
trench is quite indistinguishable, as the embankment, which in this
case has been formed on the side of the hill, is sloped so as completely
to coincide with the angle at which the latter rises from the valley.
An intelligent correspondent, familiar with this part of the Highlands,
informs me that he had frequently visited the Glen without being
aware of the existence of the trench, though passing it at no great
distance, and his attention was first called to it by observing the fresh
colour of the herbage on the upper edge of the embankment, in contrast
with the more olive hue of the hill-side beyond,&mdash;a phenomenon
easily accounted for by the fall of the heavier and coarser debris of
the embankment towards its base, thus leaving a finer soil along
the ridge. Angus M'Donald, an old and intelligent native of the
Glen, at once assigned its origin to troublous times, for the purpose
of sheltering the natives and cattle of the Glen when surprised by an
invading foe, and stated that it includes ample space for concealing
three hundred head of cattle.</p>

<p>Various examples corresponding to those occur in different parts of the
Highlands, belonging to no definite period, but indicating the dangers
and the resources of a pastoral people, liable to sudden and frequent
invasion by powerful warlike foes. A similar state of society, though
at a period more advanced in civilisation and the practice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
constructive arts, appears to be indicated in that remarkable class of
structures peculiar to Scotland, and generally known as Burghs or
Pictish-towers. These, like so many other of our native antiquities, it
has been customary to ascribe to a Danish origin; but the increasing
interest now manifested by native antiquaries in our northern antiquities,
and the frequent communications which have taken place
of late years between Scandinavian and British Archæologists, have
sufficed to establish the important fact that no such structures are
known in the old lands of the Northmen.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>The Scottish Burghs are large circular fortresses, or bell-shaped
structures, built of unhewn stone, and entirely without cement.
The most perfect example of these remarkable edifices is situated
upon the island of Mousa, near to the mainland of Zetland; but many
remains of them can still be traced, both on the northern and western
isles, in Caithness and Sutherland, and on various parts of the north
and west coasts of Scotland. They are nearly all formed precisely
on the same plan, though differing considerably in size. The form is
a truncated cone, occasionally slightly varied, as in that of Mousa,
where the wall curves inward till it attains a certain height, and then
returns gradually outward again, apparently with the same design as
the corbelled battlements of a later date, which enabled the defenders
more effectually to annoy any assailant who ventured to approach the
base. With this exception the exterior displays no ornamental projections,
or any provision for defensive operations, by means of window,
loop-hole, or machicolation. The rude but very substantial
masonry of the exterior is only broken by a plain narrow doorway,
which, from the absence of gate-posts, grooves, or any of the ordinary
refinements of more modern architecture, it is not improbable was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
secured, when danger was imminent, by building it up with a pile of
stones. Within the exterior cone a second cylindrical structure is
reared, the walls of which are either perpendicular, or constructed at
an angle which, leaving a space between the two of about six feet
at the base, brings them together at the top. Within this space between
the walls a rude staircase, or rather inclined passage, communicates
round the whole, and a series of chambers or tiers of interspaces,
formed by means of long stones laid across from wall to wall, so
as to form flooring and ceiling, are lighted by square apertures looking
into the interior area. This central space is open to the sky, and
the fact of the only light to the chambers and passages within being
derived by means of apertures opening into it, seems to preclude the
idea of its ever having been roofed. It is not apparent, however, by
what means the occupants could obtain access to the ramparts, so as
to resist an assault, and prevent the walls from being scaled, though
a sufficiently rude and simple wooden structure may have supplied
this very obvious defect.</p>

<p>Cordiner and Pennant have each given a very full account of Dun
Dornadil, a Burgh or Pictish tower in Glenelg, and one of the largest
of this singular class of military structures.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Gordon furnishes descriptions
and engravings of Castle Tellve and Castle Troddan, two
other examples which he examined;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and Dr. Macculloch also supplies
a minute account and measurements of one of those, in Glenelg.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
"The masonry," he remarks, "is without lime, but remarkably
well laid, and the lines of the curvature are beautifully preserved
throughout. The floors of the galleries consist of single flags, and
the window apertures are, in a similar manner, divided by transoms
of stone."</p>

<p>One necessary consequence of the plan on which all these buildings
are constructed is, that while the lower galleries are roomy, and admit
of free passage, the space narrows so rapidly that the upper ones are
too straitened even to admit a child. This is particularly observable
in the Burgh of Mousa, which, though more perfect, is considerably
smaller than that of Dun Dornadil, and consequently a much greater
proportion of the internal galleries must have been totally unavailable,
either for occupation or the storing of property. No great difficulty,
however, need be made about this, even where windows are found made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>in the inner wall, equally for the wide and the most straitened tiers
of galleries. One model, and that a very simple one, supplied the design
for all; and it would not be difficult to find corresponding examples
in modern masonry where the same unreasoning fidelity to
the original is shewn, as in the latest structures of the Tudor style,
where unperforated gargoyles project from solid walls, and flying buttresses
are thrown where there is nothing to support.</p>

<p>The most remarkable deviation from the common arrangement of
these singular structures is where, as in the Burgh of Achir-na-Kyle,
Sutherland, regular conical chambers are constructed in the solid
wall. This is a manifest refinement upon the original design, and
may be regarded as the first progressive step in the art of military
architecture. Cordiner remarks of this example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is situated with peculiar taste on the top of a lofty rock, opposite to some
pleasant woods, and near excellent pasture; and round the precipice which overhangs
the Brora, the river tumbles over its rocky channel in a number of irregular
cascades. This building would have doubtless merited a very particular description,
had it not corresponded with your account of those in Glenelg.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> I must
except the apartments within the walls, which are of an oval form, distinct and
entire, about eight feet long, six high, and four wide. Those on the ground-floor
are still a retreat from the storm for the goats that feed on the neighbouring hills.
The stairs from the first to the second row of chambers are regular and commodiously
made out. The apartments are carefully lighted by windows from within,
a strong evidence that the area within these towers had never been closed above,
or entirely covered. The door looks over the precipice towards the river, and is
full six feet high.... One chamber had several plans of a level entry to it, and
measured nine feet in height; this had been probably intended for the chieftain.
The whole structure seems to me so well contrived that it is not easy to conceive
a people who could not work in wood or iron could have been more conveniently
accommodated in places of defence."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p></div>

<p>Considerable skill and ingenuity is frequently shewn, both in the
choice of a site for these defences and in turning it to the best account.
They most frequently occupy capes, headlands, or small
islands, either in a lake or on the open sea. Sir Walter Scott describes
a curious device which he observed employed for guarding
one of those in Shetland against the approach of strangers. "I remember,"
he remarks, "the remains of one upon an island in a small
lake near Lerwick, which at high tide communicates with the sea, the
access to which is very ingenious by means of a causeway or dyke,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>about three or four inches under the surface of the water. This causeway
makes a sharp angle in its approach to the Burgh. The inhabitants,
doubtless, were well acquainted with this, but strangers, who
might approach in a hostile manner, and were ignorant of the curve
of the causeway, would probably plunge into the lake, which is six
or seven feet deep at the least. This must have been the device of
some Vauban or Cohorn of those early times."</p>

<p>These remarkable buildings can hardly be viewed with too great
an interest by the Scottish archæologist. They are the earliest native
architectural remains which we possess, the cromlechs and stone
circles being at best only rudimentary and symbolic or representative
forms of architecture. They constitute, therefore, a most important
element in our national history, supplying very definite facts relating
to an ancient era of which we have received no other information in
any degree so trustworthy. The first point accordingly is to ascertain,
with such accuracy and minuteness as may now be possible, the precise
nature of these facts. Careful investigations have accordingly
been carried on of late years, accompanied in several instances with
excavations around the buildings and within the inclosed area, the
results of which are worthy of note. In more than one instance
human remains have been found on removing the accumulated rubbish
and debris from these ancient ruins, suggesting the possibility of their
correspondence to the <i>Nuraghes</i> of Sardinia, which they somewhat
resemble in outward form. It is altogether inconceivable, however,
to ascribe a sepulchral origin to these chambered towers; while the
same excavations which have discovered the remains of the dead have
also in most cases furnished no less conclusive evidence of the former
presence of the living. But, it has been already observed, the archæologist
finds both "knowledge and understanding" in the grave, and
esteems it a conceivable source of valuable insight to have even these
dead to question on the subject. Dr. Macculloch mentions the discovery
of human bones in the Burgh of Glenelg, but without entering
into details; but the results of a careful examination of another of
these towers, near Dunrobin, in the summer of 1849, elicited more
definite information. On removing the rubbish from the chambers
and galleries, a human skeleton was found in one of them, while excavations
within the open area disclosed abundant traces of a fire in
the centre, and also discovered several stone quernes or hand-mills.
The skeleton here appeared obviously to belong to a later period than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
the quernes and the central fire; but no accompanying relics of the
deceased were found to tell how long the fire of the old garrison had
been extinguished ere the chamber of their fort was made a receptacle
for the dead. More satisfactory results attended the examination of
the Burgh of Burghar, another of these singular towers in the parish
of Evie, Orkney. It is described by Mr. A. Peterkin, in a letter addressed
to Dr. Hibbert in 1825, as the most perfect though not the
largest of several in the neighbourhood. Several barrows occur in the
vicinity, some of which have been opened and found to contain urns.
The central area of the Burgh of Burghar was nearly filled up with
the accumulated ruins and rubbish of centuries, and resisted more
than one effort to explore it; but the son of the clergyman of the
parish renewed the attempt
in the spring of
1825, and succeeded in
partially investigating
the contents of the ruined
area. On digging out
the earth and rubbish,
he found a human skeleton, beside which lay part of a deer's horn,
and the rude bone comb represented here, about one-third the size of
the original, which is now deposited in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries. Mr. Peterkin appears also to have forwarded the skull
to Dr. Hibbert, though it has not been preserved. His description of
it has already been noticed in a former chapter.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 589px;">
<img src="images/image424.jpg" width="589" height="240" alt="" />
</div>

<p>More extensive excavations were made within the ruined burgh at
a subsequent period, and led to the discovery of some very valuable
relics, including two fine gold armillæ, now in the possession of the
Earl of Zetland. In this example also there can be little hesitation
in assuming that the deposition of the dead body did not take place
till the abandonment of the burgh, perhaps not till it had been long
in ruins, as it does not appear from the description to have been
below the level of the original floor, but within the accumulated soil
which encumbered the area. This, however, is open to doubt, as
the letter is not quite explicit; and if the interment was at some
depth below the floor, it might have taken place while the burgh
was occupied, and an assailing force precluded access to the neighbouring
downs on which the aboriginal sepulchral tumuli are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
visible. It may be doubted whether the gold relics were placed there
as a sepulchral deposit, or only for security or concealment. They belong
possibly to a period long subsequent to that of the first interment
with its simple and rude accompaniment of the bone comb. The
latter discovery, indeed, seems to furnish some approximation to the
period of those buildings. It shews, what we might expect, that they
are the work of a people whose arts were extremely rude, and so far
as any general reasoning may be built on a solitary instance, it seems
to point to the erection of the burghs at a period long prior to the
earliest recorded traces of Scandinavian invasion. The discovery,
however, is not altogether without precedent. Another bone comb in
the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, of even ruder construction,
though nearly resembling the one found at Burghar in its general form,
was found, in 1782, in the ruins of another burgh in Caithness, and a
third discovered under similar circumstances is in the museum at Kirkwall.
There appears, indeed, to have been a predilection for burying
among the debris of the ruined forts, which must be supposed to have
been formed long subsequent to their abandonment as strongholds
and places of abode, and therefore adds to the evidence of their great
antiquity. Some of these interments are undoubtedly traceable to
the period of the Scandinavian occupation of the Orkney Isles.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>How of Hoxay.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. W. H. Fotheringham of Kirkwall, Orkney, has communicated
to me an account of the recent exploration of another ruin of a circular
fort, apparently belonging to the same class of buildings as those
previously described. It occupies as usual an isolated promontory,
called the How of Hoxay, in South Ronaldshay, immediately opposite
to the Bay of Scupa. Rising abruptly from the small Bay of Hoxay
is the How or Height of Hoxay, on the top of which are the remains
of a circular building. Until brought to light in the course of recent
excavations it was entirely buried beneath the accumulated soil, and
presented only the appearance of an earthen tumulus. It has now
been completely exposed externally, and the inclosed area excavated
to the surface of the rock, so that the work of exploration has been
most effectually performed. The external wall measures fourteen feet
in thickness, and about eight feet in greatest height, and incloses an
area of about thirty feet in diameter. The construction of the wall is
singular, the exterior and interior facings appearing to have been carefully
built with unhewn stones fitted together with great nicety, and
the intervening space filled up with stones thrown in with little care
or design. No cement had been used, but the wall is still strong and
without any displacement in the facings, though so much ruined that
no certain idea can now be formed of its original height. The great
quantity of stones which lay both within and about it served, however,
to shew that only a small portion of the original fabric remains.
The accompanying view of the most perfect side of the interior will
convey a better idea of the general appearance and details than any
description could do. The two upright stones about half way up the
wall on the left of the drawing appear to be the side-posts either of a
door or outlook, to which the projecting step below was probably designed
to give access; but it was found built up like the other parts
of the walls, and the proprietor having since, in a misdirected zeal for
the preservation of the ruin, had the whole pointed with lime, it is no
longer possible to detect the additions of later builders. Round the
inner circumference of the wall upright flag-stones project at intervals
of six feet apart. Only six of these now remain, but the fragments
of others were discovered among the debris. In the recesses formed
by these projecting stones there were found several stone quernes, a
shallow stone mortar and pestle, or corn-crusher, of the rudest and most
primitive construction, and also two smaller circular stone vessels, the
one seven and the other five inches in diameter, and both about four
and a half inches deep. The remains of the doorway in the eastern and
most ruined part of the wall appear to have been of an unusually intricate
construction, but these also have unfortunately been obliterated
by later repairs, the whole wall having been raised to a uniform height,
and a platform and flagstaff superadded in very questionable taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
The proprietor was actuated in his labours by a sincere desire for
the preservation of this venerable ruin, and antiquaries must respect
his motives, though he has not effected it exactly in the way they
would have wished. I am favoured by Mr. Fotheringham with the
following description and sketch:&mdash;"As to the door on the east side,
the information I have got is that it was contracted by means of
slates thus; and that at the side of the door was a chamber in
the thickness of the wall
leading from the interior,
from which there
was an aperture or slit
to the widest part of the
doorway, either for the
purpose of outlook, or for
projecting a weapon against a hostile intruder." This arrangement
in the construction of the doorway more nearly approaches the plans
for outlook and defence with which we are familiar in medieval military
architecture. It is greatly to be regretted that no opportunity
was afforded for more accurate observation.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 614px;">
<img src="images/image427.jpg" width="614" height="217" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The result of these investigations is highly satisfactory and encouraging,
giving promise of further information from the labours of
future explorers. Meanwhile some important conclusions may be
arrived at. It is not necessary that we should follow Cordiner in his
learned arguments concerning King Dornadil, a successor of Fergus I.,
who ascended the throne <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 263, and signalized his reign by erecting
the Burgh of Dun Dornadil on the north-west coast of Inverness-shire.
With precise dates the archæologist can rarely, if ever, have aught
to do while treating of primitive antiquities; but this at least seems
established, that they are native erections, and belong for the most
part to a period long prior to the era of Scandinavian invasion. Where
the Teutonic and Scandinavian races ultimately prevailed they bear
the name of Burghs; where the older Celtic race and language survive
they retain the name of Duns: and Sir Walter Scott has pointed out,
in an ingenious note appended to Ivanhoe, that the venerable Saxon
stronghold of Conigsburgh is only a refinement on the older model
of the Scottish burghs. This has been illustrated by drawings and
sections in the Abbotsford edition of the novels, and the resemblance
is certainly sufficient to carry much probability with it, though at the
same time the complicated arrangements, and the provisions for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
aggressive operations against assailants in the burgh of the southern
Saxon, cannot but add to the conviction that the Scottish strongholds
of this class belong to a much earlier period. They are manifestly
the work of an ingenious and patient race, who aimed far more at
defence than aggression. Strongholds they undoubtedly are, but they
retain no trace of features strictly adapting them to military posts.
The Saxon burghs of England were rapidly superseded by the more
efficient keep of their Norman conquerors; yet when we institute a
comparison between Conigsburgh and Mousa or Dun Dornadil, it
seems to present a contrast not unlike that which distinguishes the
defensive operations of the wild-cat and the hedgehog!&mdash;a contrast
which either marks a very great change on the character of the hardy
tribes that withstood the Roman legions, or indicates a marked difference
between the races which occupied the northern and southern
regions of Caledonia.</p>

<p>Dr. Macculloch remarks of these Scottish burghs,&mdash;"From the expensive
nature of their construction, or the power of hands that must
have been employed on them, it might be supposed that they were
the palaces or castles of the chiefs or kings of the days in which they
were erected. But it seems an insuperable objection to this notion,
that four should have existed within so small a distance from each
other in Glenelg, or that so many should be found in Sutherland and
in Shetland not far asunder. The limits of territory that surround
any one are too narrow for any chief; and where all chiefs were in a
state of general and constant hostility, it is not likely that they
should have chosen to build so near to each other. It is equally
impossible that they should have been the dwellings of the inhabitants
in general, as the expense of erection bears no proportion to
the limited accommodation they could afford." The expense of erection
is, in other words, the labour, time being of small value in a primitive
state of society; and when their number is taken into consideration
along with their limited accommodation, it is difficult to
evade the conclusion that they were the temporary places of shelter
of a people liable to sudden inroads from powerful foes, like the
palisaded log-house or fort which the first settlers in the backwood
frontiers of America were wont to erect as a place of safe retreat on
any attack of the treacherous aborigines. There is no period that we
know of in early Scottish history to which this description so aptly
applies as to that immediately preceding the conquest of the Ork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>neys
by Harold Harfager, about the year 880. Prior to this the
rude Norse Vikings were wont to make sudden descents on these
islands, as well as along the whole Scottish coast, spoiling and slaying
with the most remorseless cruelty. At such a period, therefore,
we can most readily conceive the natives of a district combining to
build a burgh, whither they could retreat so soon as the fleet of the
northmen was espied in the offing, and driving thither their cattle,
and carrying with them all their most valuable moveables, they could
lie secure till the spoilers set sail again in quest of some less watchful
prey. Experience would teach the necessary improvements requisite
for rendering these structures effectual against such foes;
while the improbability of the northmen abandoning their ships and
attempting a regular siege of one of these burghs, may account for the
absence of the very distinct provisions for offensive operations against
assailants which are so characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon burgh.</p>

<p>The Burgh of Mousa, which is still the most perfect of these ancient
strongholds, is the only one of which we have any distinct historical
notice. Torfæus tells us that Erland, the son of Harold the Fairspoken,
carried off the mother of Harold, a Norwegian jarl, who was
famed for her beauty, and took shelter with his prize in the Castle of
Mousa. Earl Harold followed and laid siege to the place, endeavouring
first to take it by assault, and afterwards to reduce it by famine.
But both means proved equally ineffectual, and the wrathful Jarl was
forced at length to agree to terms by which his mother became the
wife of her ravisher. This burgh is not only the most perfect, but
also the best adapted for defence of any that now exist; and it is not
improbable that it owes its projecting parapet, as well as the more
effective repair which has secured its preservation, to its later Norwegian
occupants.</p>

<p>Still it does not necessarily follow from the correspondence of the
state of society in the north of Scotland in the ninth century, as a
weak people, constantly liable to sudden inroads by powerful and
merciless invaders, with the apparent indications of these strongholds,
that we must therefore assume the origin of all of them to that
period. The conquest of the Orkneys, and the occupation of the
northern districts of Scotland by the northmen in the ninth century,
marks the close of a period which is still involved in almost total
darkness. How long before this the natives had learned to watch
the horizon for the dreaded fleets of the northmen, or in what form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the earliest migration of the Cruithne to the north took place, we
have yet to learn; but the very fact of the frequent descents of the
former on our coasts must be viewed as affording some evidence that
the arts of civilisation had advanced far beyond the rude state indicated
by such primitive relics as those which were discovered in the
How of Hoxay. The "exactors of rings" could have found little to
tempt a second visit to the barbarian Orcades of the Stone Period;
for the wandering Vikings knew not the pride of conquest which
could tempt a Cæsar to guide his legions to the Ultima Thule, that
he might return to the proud honours of a Roman triumph. The
disappointed Viking might indeed be not inaptly supposed to apostrophize
the outlooking Orcadian, as the English poet Cowper has
done the "Gentle Savage" of Tahiti:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Expect it not. We found no bait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tempt us in thy country.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We travel far, 'tis true, but not for nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must be bribed to compass earth again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By other hopes and richer fruits than yours."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Without attempting to deduce from such evidence as is now attainable,
more than it seems fairly to warrant, it is obvious that we have
followed down the unwritten history of our island from that remote
and imperfectly defined era in which we catch the first glimpses of
its occupation by wanderers from the eastern home of our common
race, to the period when definite history begins, and written records
supply to some extent the information heretofore painfully sought
amid the relics of older times. There still remains, however, some
few pages more of these archæological annals to be deciphered before
we attempt to sift the perplexing mixture of truth and fable which
makes up our earlier written history.</p>

present at a short distance, or scattered in
fragments about the plain. The same is
true here, (Dunadeer); and in both cases
the forts are not erected out of the materials
nearest at hand, which are infusible,
but collected with considerable labour from
a distance. It is hence evident that the
builders of these works were aware of the
qualities of these various rocks; and it is
equally evident that they chose the fusible
in preference to the infusible, although with
a considerable increase of labour. The obvious
conclusion is that they designed from the
beginning to vitrify their walls."&mdash;Highlands

countries; and Professor Munch of the

confirms this, and assures me, after a personal
inspection of several, that he is convinced
they are of native origin, and peculiar
to Scotland. There can be little doubt
that Dr. Macculloch's "incontrovertible

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

WEAPONS, IMPLEMENTS, AND POTTERY.</h3>


<p>The state of isolation, with all its attendant influences, must now
be considered finally at a close. The effects of European civilisation
rapidly modified the primitive native arts; and during this era, to
which the name of Iron Period is applied, that strange mingling of
races was chiefly effected which has resulted in our singular British
nationality, in our peculiar virtues and our equally peculiar deficiencies.
The Roman influence also failed not, even while indirectly operating,
greatly to accelerate the development of the new era. Long before
the invasion of Julius Cæsar, or the Roman working of lead and iron
mines in England, the increasing demands for iron in the south of
Europe could not fail to add somewhat also to the supplies of the
north; nor is it improbable that the impetus communicated to the
European workers in metals during the protracted struggles of the
Punic wars, and the civil commotions which followed on the final
supremacy of Rome, mainly contributed to furnish the native Britons
with the arms by means of which they withstood both Julius Cæsar
and Agricola.</p>

<p>Whatever effect the long occupation of England as a Roman province
may have had on the native mythology and sepulchral rites, we
have no reason to think that any change was produced on those of
Scotland. Relics of the Roman period have been found in tumuli
and cairns alongside of the rude British cinerary urn, the bronze
spear, and even the stone celt; nor was it till the introduction of
Christianity that the Scottish circumscribed cist was entirely abandoned
for a sepulchre of ampler proportions. Sepulchral pottery is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
found alongside of relics of all periods, from the rudest primeval
era to that of the general adoption of Christianity; but even where
it is accompanied with Roman relics it betrays no indications of
any familiarity with the artistic design or manufacturing processes
of the Roman potter. The transition is at once from the primitive
pottery apparently to that introduced by the Anglo-Saxons. On
warlike implements, however, it is probable that the collision with
the Roman legions exercised an important influence, though it is
now difficult to ascertain its precise character or extent. The state
of decomposition in which iron relics are usually found frequently
renders it impossible to discriminate between those of Pagan and
medieval eras. A few Scottish examples which have been noted
from time to time, will, however, supply the means of forming some
conclusions relative to the arts of this period.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Miller in his "Inquiry respecting the Site of
the Battle of Mons Grampius," thus describes some of the antiquities
of the locality, which he conceives, with considerable probability, to
be relics of native art contemporary with the Roman invasion of
North Britain in the second century:&mdash;"At a point near Gateside a
vast cairn stood until about forty-two years ago, and there the last
stand of the Caledonians in a body seems to have been made. Upon
removing this cairn many bones were found, and great quantities of
iron. Many of the pieces were very small, so as to be called knives
and forks by the workmen. Others again were very large; too much
so, one might almost suppose, from the account I have had of them,
even for the <i>enormes gladios</i> of the Caledonians. None of them have
unfortunately been preserved, as they were probably completely
oxidized, and reckoned of no value. Great numbers of beads were
also found in the cairn, and distributed about the country at the time
as curiosities. A few of these are still preserved, and serve to convey
rather a favourable idea of the state of the arts at the time. Some
of them were of a long elliptical form, and made of jet; others were
made of a bluish glass, and shaded with spiral or circular lines; while
others were white, enamelled with red and blue spots, the colours of
which are as vivid as ever."<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The same writer describes a great
variety of stone and bronze relics found under a variety of circumstances
throughout that district of Fifeshire. Many of these, however,
must have belonged to very different periods, and most pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>bably
also to different races that succeeded each other in the occupation
of the fertile region of country lying between the estuaries of
the Forth and Tay, though all are pressed by him into the service, in
order to add to the accumulated evidence by which he seeks to assign
a precise site to the famed battle-field of Agricola and Galgacus.
On the 22d November 1849, some farm-servants engaged in draining
a field at East Langton, in the parish of Kirknewton, Mid-Lothian,
found a skeleton about three and a half feet below the surface. The
body lay south-west by north-east, imbedded in moss about three
inches thick. Near the feet were found an iron knife, and a dagger
with the remains of a wooden handle and a square gold plate and knob
on the end of the haft, both greatly corroded and adhering together
from the rust. There were also found in the same grave a wooden
comb, broken and very much decayed, and a rude bodkin of bone
measuring three and a quarter inches long, which had doubtless been
employed in fastening the dress of the deceased. The knife is perforated
with three holes, by which a handle must have been attached
to it, but it is too much corroded to afford any correct idea of its original
form. Near to these lay a wooden vessel and an earthen urn
coated with green glaze, and rudely ornamented with a waved pattern;
both of which were broken by the carelessness of the workmen.
The accompanying woodcut represents the dagger and bone pin, the
former of which measures with the handle thirteen and a quarter
inches long. Nearly at the same time a quantity of billon pennies
of James II., of the Edinburgh Mint,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> were discovered in the field
where this interesting sepulchral deposit was found. But it had
been in cultivation upwards of fifty years, and there is no reason to
think that any connexion was traceable between the two discoveries.</p>

</div>

<p>The glazed pottery accompanying the iron weapons at East Langton
is a characteristic feature of the sepulchral deposits of the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
Pagan period in Scotland, and is perhaps one of the earliest indications
of Anglo-Saxon influence. During the progress of the
railway works for constructing a branch line of the North British
Railway to North-Berwick, in 1848, two stone cists were discovered
on the Abbey Farm, both of them measuring a little more than four
feet in length, and each containing a human skeleton. In one of
them was found an iron sword and dagger, both so much corroded as
to break and crumble to pieces in the careless hands of the railway
navies. At the side of the skeletons, in both cists, were urns of
rough grey ware, ornamented externally with
parallel grooves running round them, and internally
covered with a green glaze. The woodcut
represents one of these rescued in a partially
dilapidated state from the railway excavators,
and now in the possession of Andrew Richardson,
Esq. It measures fully six inches in height,
and it will be seen bears a singularly close resemblance
to another urn of somewhat smaller
dimensions, found in Aberdeenshire, and described below.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/image434.jpg" width="316" height="399" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1791, four urns were discovered under a large stone near Drumglow
Hill, Kincardineshire, and some others in a neighbouring cairn,
of which the sole description given is that they were made of very
coarse materials, and the outside glazed and ornamented with dotted
lines.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> In 1832, Lieutenant-Colonel Miller presented to the Society
of Scottish Antiquaries "a finely formed barbed arrow-head of flint,
and a fragment of what is supposed by the donor to have been a
glazed sepulchral vase, found at Merlsford, at the foot of the Lomond
Hill, Fifeshire."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> This specimen is too imperfect to furnish any idea
of the form of the vase, though it affords additional evidence of the
introduction of this characteristic change in the primitive Scottish
pottery at an early period.</p>

<p>The Old Statistical Account of the parish of Rathen contains a
description of three cairns at Memsie, on the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire,
which, it is remarked, "were very large, till of late, that
great quantities of the stones have been taken away from two of
them. The remains of human bones were lately found in one of
them." The renewed invasion of one of these cairns about the year
1824 led to the discovery of the small urn here engraved. It mea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>sures
four and a quarter inches in height, three inches in diameter at
the bottom, and four at the top. Externally it is rough and destitute
of any ornament, except the six parallel grooves which appear in the
woodcut. Within it is entirely coated with a dark green glaze.
Unfortunately, however, its most remarkable features no longer exist.
Mr. John Gordon of Cairnbulg remarks in a letter with which he
accompanied the donation of the urn to the Society in 1827,&mdash;"The
urn has two projecting ears opposite each other, which fitted into
corresponding double ones attached to a lid, by which the vessel,
when found, was closely covered; and the whole of the projections
were perforated to admit a pin which completed the fastening. The
lid was unfortunately broken in opening the urn. It was made of
the same materials, and fitted into the mouth which was formed for
its reception." Part of the rim has also been broken away, but
enough remains to shew, that above each projecting ear is an opening
into which the lid had fitted as an additional security. No mention
is made of anything having been found within
the urn thus carefully secured, but beside it lay
a sword, unfortunately no longer known to exist.
It is described as "one-edged; the hilt of brass,
the blade iron, seventeen inches and a quarter
long, one inch and a quarter broad at the guard,
from whence it tapers to the point; when found
it was enclosed in a wooden scabbard." It appears
to have borne considerable resemblance to an iron sword found
by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, in a tumulus opened by him at King's
Barrow, in the Vale of Warminster, "which had a handle of oakwood.
The blade was about eighteen inches long, two inches wide, and
single-edged."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/image435.jpg" width="378" height="388" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the year 1800, Mr. Robert Dalyell presented to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland, a sword fractured in several pieces, portions
of a helmet, battle-axe, and spear, all of iron, found under a cairn on
his estate of Hunthills, Roxburghshire. But the whole are too much
corroded to convey any very distinct idea of their original forms, though
they add additional evidence in proof of the continued use of the
sepulchral cairn, after the full development of the Teutonic era, with
its characteristic implements of iron. In 1834 Professor Traill exhibited
at a meeting of the Scottish Antiquaries the fragments of an
iron sword, apparently that of a man of distinction, found along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
the boss of a shield, at a place called Swenedrow, in Rowsey, Orkney.
In the same place many fragments of ancient armour have been discovered;
and the Professor believed the sword to have belonged to
one of the Norwegian jarls.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Pennant engraves another ancient
sword discovered in the island of Islay;<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> nor are such discoveries
rare, though they have seldom obtained the minute attention they
merit. A remarkable discovery of arms and other iron relics was
made in the month of August 1834, at Fendoch Camp, an intrenchment
on the river Almond, about five miles north-east of Crieff, in
Perthshire. It is commonly described as a Roman camp, and the
urns found in numerous cairns which surrounded it are no less unhesitatingly
assigned to the legionary invaders. A drawing which I
possess of one of the urns found inverted within a cist under one of
the cairns, leaves no room to doubt that these sepulchral mounds, at
least, are of British origin, and probably of a date long prior to the
era of Roman invasion. On the occasion above referred to, while a
labourer was digging across the eastern rampart of Fendoch Camp,
he discovered at some depth below the surface three iron pots or
kettles, the largest of which broke in pieces while he was in the act
of raising it from the ground. The other two measured ten inches in
diameter by four and a half in depth, and eight and a half inches in
diameter by three inches in depth. They were each composed of a
series of concentric circles rivetted together, the larger one having a
straight handle twenty-one inches in length. Along with these were
also found three heads of spears or javelins seven inches in length, a
portion of a sword-blade eighteen and a half inches in length, three
pairs of bits, two pairs of shears eleven inches long, the blades alone
measuring four inches, a sort of spoon or ladle ten inches in extreme
length of handle and bowl, a beautiful hinge of yellowish metal four
inches long, carved and plated with silver, in excellent preservation,
besides various other implements. The most of these interesting
relics were carefully packed in the largest kettle, and a flat stone
placed on its mouth. This curious hoard was purchased by my friend,
Mr. John Buchanan of Glasgow, under whose zealous care they might
have been deemed secure of a safe asylum, but the weighty box in which
they were packed tempted some covetous knave, and our only poor consolation
for their loss is to picture the mortification of the thief when
he unlocked his treasure and found only a chest full of rusty iron!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>But this unhappily is no solitary example of the destruction of
ancient Scottish relics. "Vast quantities of arms," says the author
of the Statistical Account of the parish of Cummertrees, Dumfriesshire,
writing in 1834, "were lately found in a field on the farm of
Corrieknows, near the burgh of Annan. The farmer who found
them had them all, but a brass battle-axe, converted into husbandry
utensils."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> From inquiries since made, I find that the brass battle-axe
was a bronze celt, so that, if we may assume, as seems most probable,
that the iron weapons belonged to the same era, we have here
most interesting examples of the weapons of the Teutonic Period.
The farmer describes the swords as about two feet in length, edged
on the one side to the handle, and on the other for the half length of
the blade. Beside them lay some long spear-heads, nearly all broken,
and more injured by rust than the swords. In the same field he also
found a number of horse-shoes, some of which were an entire circle,
and others curiously turned in at the heel. On the farm of Broom,
in the same parish, there is a field called Bruce's Acres, where King
Robert is said to have been defeated by the English; but the singular
form of the horses' shoes found at Corrieknows adds additional evidence
of these relics belonging to an earlier period. In the Museum
of the Scottish Antiquaries there are horse-shoes from the field of
Bannockburn and from that of Nisbetmuir, Berwickshire, fought
24th June 1355, after the captivity of King David Bruce. They are
chiefly remarkable for their very diminutive size, and in no way correspond
to those described above. Antique horse-shoes of a different
form have repeatedly been found in the neighbourhood of Carlinwark
Loch, Kirkcudbrightshire, a prolific source of valuable archæological
relics. The ancient name of Castle Douglas, on the margin of the
loch, is Causeway End, from its position in relation to an ancient
causeway constructed through the marsh, and believed to be a part of
one of the great Roman roads. About this place most of the ancient
horse-shoes have been discovered. One of them in the collection of
Mr. Joseph Train is described by him as consisting of a solid piece of
iron, not made to go round the edge of the hoof, but to cover the
whole. On the inside, especially towards the heel, it is hollowed so
as not to press upon the soft part of the foot. Though much worn in
front this cumbrous lump of iron still weighs about six pounds, so that
four of them must have formed no slight impediment to a horse. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>what period these equestrian furnishings should be assigned it is not
easy to determine. No relic yet discovered along with the remains
of horses, so frequently found in the later tumuli, suggests the idea of
the early Britons having shod the horses which they attached to their
war-chariots. Montfaucon, however, describes a small iron horse-shoe
which was discovered in 1653, in the tomb of Childeric, founder of
the French monarchy, whose horse had been interred along with him,
A.D. 481. The Rev. Samuel Pegge, in an ingenious paper "On the
Shoeing of Horses among the Ancients,"<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> conceives that the custom
was introduced into England by William the Conqueror; but it seems
exceedingly improbable that either the Anglo-Romans or the Anglo-Saxons
should have remained ignorant of a device which some allusions
of Homer would lead us to suppose was not unknown even to
the Greeks of the Bronze Period.</p>

<p>Ure describes and engraves in his History of the Parish of East
Kilbride,<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> a very interesting discovery made at Castlemilk in 1792, of
a helmet, gorget, dagger, and other iron relics, along with which were
two bronze vessels, one of them of peculiar form, and also the remains
of a leaden vase; but these it is probable were medieval antiquities.
No doubt, however, can be entertained of the era of another iron relic
described by him, but of which unfortunately no engraving exists.
Some workmen engaged in demolishing a cairn in the same parish
found in it a large urn filled with human bones, and close by it an
iron implement designated "an old spade of a clumsy shape," but
which was more probably an ancient bill or battle-axe. Mr. Robert
Riddell describes two such weapons, figured in the Archæologia.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
They were found in a moss near Terregles, Dumfriesshire, and
measure each two and a half feet long, and above two inches thick at
the back, though greatly corroded with rust. The Kilbride discoverers,
on finding the urn, had confidently anticipated that its contents
would prove a golden treasure, which they magnanimously resolved
should be equitably divided. Having gulped down their mortification
as best they might on finding their whole treasure dwindle to an
old iron bill, "it was at length unanimously agreed that it should not
be sold; it might, for anything they knew, be uncommonly ominous,
especially as it was iron, and taken out of a grave which was generally
believed to be haunted." So the desired division of the spoil was at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>length secured by having the curious relic converted into tackets or
hobnails for their shoes!<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The general character of the older Scottish superstitions in regard
to iron, of which we have here some indications, more frequently
refer to it rather as a charm against spells and malign influences of
all sorts, entirely corresponding in this respect with the popular
creed of Norway at the present day. In describing the "Adder
Stone," Ure remarks, "It is thought by superstitious people to possess
many wonderful properties. It is used as a charm to insure prosperity,
and to prevent the malicious attacks of evil spirits. In this
case, it must be closely kept in an iron box to secure it from the
fairies, who are supposed to have an utter abhorrence at iron." This
may be compared with another canon of northern folk-lore, referred
to in a former chapter,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> in relation to the flint arrow-head or elf-bolt.
The inferences suggested by both are the same, pointing to an epoch
when iron, as a novel introduction, could in no way be associated with
the Elves and Gnomes, old as the primitive stone weapons of the
aborigines. Pennant, however, describes a curious charm against
witchcraft, in use in the Hebrides, where the milk of enchanted kine
is boiled along with both flints and untempered steel&mdash;the bane and
the antidote&mdash;which was held to give the operator complete power
over the enchanter. We are still familiar with the rustic faith in the
efficiency of the iron horse-shoe affixed to the stable-door as a certain
protection against all supernatural evil influences.</p>

<p>A remarkable class of urns, so far as I yet know peculiar to Scotland,
appears to belong for the most part to the Iron Period. They
vary in form, but all agree in the singular characteristic of being
open at both ends. One of these was discovered within the area of
a stone circle at Barrach, Aberdeenshire, by a peasant digging for
stones. It lay under a flat stone, with another placed below it, and
was found to be filled with human bones.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Others are described in
the old Statistical Reports as resembling chimney cans. But the
most minute account of this singular class of sepulchral urns is furnished
by Ure, to whose indefatigable researches within the limited
district of which he has treated we owe so many valuable reminiscences
of bygone discoveries. "In the bottom of a very small cairn on the
lands of East Rogerton, the property of his Grace the Duke of Hamilton,
were found five urns not of the ordinary shape. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>about eighteen inches high; six wide at the one end and four at the
other. Both ends were open. They were said by the workmen to be
glazed, and ornamented with flowers; and narrower in the middle
than at either end. They stood upon smooth stones distant from each
other about three-quarters of a yard, and placed in a circular form.
The top of each urn was covered with a thin piece of stone. They
were all totally destroyed by the rustic labourers." Such is the
lamentable yet ever-recurring history of our national antiquities.
Vallancey has engraved a very beautiful bronze vase, dug up in 1769,
near the church of Fahan, county of Donegal. The handles are horses'
heads, very closely corresponding to the usual artistic style of this
period; and the vase has the same remarkable peculiarity as the class
of Scottish urns referred to, in being open at both ends.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>The iron relics of the Teutonic Period by no means yield the same
amount of information as we have been able to derive from the older
weapons and implements of bronze, chiefly owing to the extreme susceptibility
of the newer metal to oxidation under nearly all the circumstances
in which both classes of antiquities are discovered. This
want, however, we shall find abundantly supplied from other sources,
including the contemporary works in bronze. Among the most characteristic
remains of the defensive armour of this period frequently
met with, the umbones of shields occupy a prominent place. The
larger ones are of sufficient size to admit the hand, and resemble
in this, as well as in other respects, those frequently met with in
England. They suffice to shew that the shield was not worn on the
arm like the Roman clypeus, but held by a bar crossing the centre
of the projecting boss, the hollow of which received and protected
the hand. In this it closely corresponded to the bronze buckler of
the previous period, which probably continued to be used contemporarily
with it. An example of an iron umbo found in Morayshire
is figured on a subsequent page. Another, referred to in a brief summary
given in the Nenia Britannica, of relics found at Westray,
Orkney, is described as "a very small iron vessel like a head-piece,
only four and a half inches in the hollow, bruised apparently by a
sword or an axe." In the Scottish Museum is a small iron boss, found
at Corbiehall, near Carstairs, Lanarkshire, which is only slightly
raised in the centre. The locality where it was discovered has furnished
many Roman remains, among which it most probably ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
to be classed. In general form it closely resembles an exceedingly
beautiful boss of a Roman shield in the same collection,
made of bronze, and decorated in relief with a crowned
female figure seated, holding Victory in her hand, and
surrounded with the spoils of war.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 69px;">
<img src="images/image441.jpg" width="69" height="636" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A rarer and more remarkable object pertaining to this
period is the iron sword, inclosed in its bronze sheath,
several very fine examples of which have been found at
different times. One of these occurred in the very valuable
collection of antiquities discovered at Stanwich,
now deposited in the British Museum. Another similar
example, found on a moor near Flasby, parish Gargrave,
in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was exhibited during
the meeting of the Archæological Institute at York in
1846. In both of these the iron blade of the sword was
still inclosed in the sheath. The annexed illustration is
copied from a very perfect bronze scabbard closely resembling
the two found in England, now in the Museum of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. It appears from
an inscription roughly scratched on it to have been found
on the Mortonhall estate, at the foot of the Pentland
Hills, in the immediate vicinity of the Scottish capital.
The blade of this sword must have measured twenty-two
and a half inches in length by one inch in breadth,&mdash;an
exceedingly small and light weapon compared with the
<i>enormes gladii</i> which Tacitus describes the Caledonians
as using. It appears to have been a straight two-edged
weapon, with a sharp point, and was perhaps designedly
adapted for more convenient and ready use by the charioteer
than the more ponderous sword generally borne
by the native Britons. The different examples which
have been heretofore noted are furnished with the same
large bronze loop which is shewn in the woodcut, attached
to the middle of the scabbard, the precise use of
which is not quite apparent. The style of ornament
entirely corresponds to that employed in decorating the
personal ornaments and the horse-furniture of this
period, and supplies evidence of a remarkable change from the undefined
ornamentation of the Archaic works in bronze.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

PERSONAL ORNAMENTS.</h3>


<p>It has been already noticed that silver appears to have been a
metal very little known in Britain, or the north of Europe, prior to
the changes which we associate with the introduction of iron; nor is
it difficult, as we have seen, to account for this. The rarity of iron
during the primitive periods arises chiefly from the occurrence of the
ore in a form least resembling metal, and requiring the most laborious
and difficult processes to reduce it to a state fit for use; while the
absence of silver is no less satisfactorily accounted for from the mining
operations requisite for reaching the argentiferous veins, which were
only possible when the introduction of the more useful metals had
supplied an abundance of the requisite tools. One class of the earliest
silver ornaments, however, retains the same primitive and indefinite
style of decoration which has already been described as occurring on
the pottery, and also on some of the bronze and gold ornaments found
in the tumuli. A very valuable series of examples of this type are
figured in the Archæological Journal, in illustration of an account by
Mr. Hawkins of the discovery of a number of armlets, and various
other silver relics, at Cuerdale, near Preston, along with Anglo-Saxon,
Cufic, and other coins.</p>

<p>In the month of November 1830, some labourers engaged in digging
for stones, in a field near Quendale, Orkney, came upon the remains
of an old building, and, in digging among the rubbish, they found a
decayed horn, which appeared to have been wrapped up in a piece of
cloth, but the whole crumbled to pieces on exposure to the air. On
the outside of the horn were what were at first supposed to be metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
hoops, but which proved to be six silver bracelets. They were penannular,
and tapered nearly to a point at the ends. The largest of
them were square, and ornamented with a kind of herring-bone pattern;
the remainder were round. The weight of the heaviest was
nearly six ounces, that of the least one ounce, and one which weighed
nearly one and a-half ounce, had silver wire coiled round it. Within
the horn were pieces of other bracelets, and a quantity of Anglo-Saxon
silver coins, including those of Ethered, Athelstan, Edwg, Eadgar, and
Ethelred; and alongside were also discovered several broken stone
basins. A few of the coins were preserved, but the armillæ, and the
remainder of the hoard, were disposed of to a goldsmith in Lerwick,
and melted down. Slight sketches of the armillæ, and a deposition
taken before the sheriff-substitute of Zetland by the discoverers, are
deposited in the library of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.
Barry describes another hoard extremely similar to this, found at
Caldale near Kirkwall. Two horns were discovered by a man while
digging peats: they contained about three hundred silver coins of
Canute the Great, and near them lay "several pieces of fine silver, in
the form of crescents or fibulæ, differing from one another a good
deal, both in figure and dimensions. Some of them were flat, others
angled; some round, some nearly met at the ends; others were wider
at the extremities; one resembled in shape the staple of a door, and
another a loop for hanging clothes upon."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> A portion of the coins
alone escaped the usual fate of British relics of the precious metals.
A silver armilla, of the same type as those discovered at Cuerdale,
was found, in the year 1756, in a cist, along with a quantity of burnt
human bones, underneath a large cairn at Blackerne, Kirkcudbrightshire,
when the stones composing the cairn were taken to inclose a
plantation. It is now in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.
A silver bracelet, of a rarer and more artistic design, was found at
Brough Head, Morayshire, by labourers engaged in digging the
foundation for a new house, and is figured of the full size in the Archæologia
Scotica.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> The woodcut represents another remarkable
Scottish relic, a massive silver chain, found in the year 1808, near
Inverness, in the course of the excavations for the Caledonian Canal.
It now forms one of the most valued treasures of the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries. It weighs a little more than ninety-three
ounces, and each link is open, and only bent together, so that it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>perhaps be assumed with considerable probability, that it was designed
to be used in barter, being in fact silver ring money. There
are thirty-three links in all, each of them measuring one and nine-tenths
inches in diameter, and about two-fifths of an inch in thickness,
excepting two at one extremity, and one at the other, each of which
are two and one-fifth inches in diameter. With this exception the
links appear to be of uniform size, and would probably be found to
correspond in weight. An additional link, which was in an imperfect
state, was destroyed by the original discoverers, in an attempt to
ascertain the nature of the metal. Another silver chain is described
in the New Statistical Account, which was found within the area of
an intrenched camp, about two miles above Greenlaw, Berwickshire,
at the confluence of the Blackadder and Faungrass rivers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 545px;">
<img src="images/image444.jpg" width="545" height="204" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Silver Chain, Caledonian Canal</p></div>
</div>

<p>Reference has already been made to the discovery of nine lunar
ornaments of silver, on opening one of the great tumuli, or Knowes of
Brogar, at Stennis, in Orkney. Notices of fibulæ, and other relics of
the same metal, are to be found scattered through the Statistical
Accounts, but mostly described in such vague terms as to render them
of little avail to the archæologist. The information is usually added
that they were immediately concealed or destroyed. A rude chain,
now in my own possession, was found during the present season in
the Isle of Skye; two of the links are of silver, and the third of
bronze. It corresponds to relics composed of fragments of rings
broken in pieces for the purpose of exchange, with which both British
and Scandinavian antiquaries are familiar. They are not uncommonly
linked together, as in the example now referred to.</p>

<p>The bronze relics of this period are much more abundant, and here
it is that we, for the first time, come in contact with examples bearing
undoubted traces of Scandinavian art, though these belong more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
correctly to the succeeding era, and will be treated of in detail,
among objects of the primitive Christian Period of Scotland. The
distinguishing characteristic of the ornamentation of the last Pagan
era, as has already been remarked, is its definiteness and positive
development of a peculiar style, along with the imitation of natural
forms. A very great similarity, however, is traceable in the ornamentation
of the whole northern races of Europe throughout a very
considerable period; and in numerous cases it is only by a careful
discrimination of details, or from some well-defined objects peculiar
to certain districts or countries, that we are able to assign a specific
epoch or nationality to discoveries. The interlaced ornament, or
"runic knotwork," as it is customary to call it, is not unfrequently
referred to as of Scandinavian origin; but of this there is not the
slightest evidence.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> It was familiar to the Greeks and Romans, and
in its classic forms is known to architects by the term <i>Guilloche</i>,
borrowed from the French. A beautiful and early example of its use
occurs on the torus of the Ionic columns of the Erectheum at Athens.
It pertains, in like manner, to Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Irish and
Scottish Celtic art, and more or less to that of all the Northern races
of the last Pagan era; while it forms a no less characteristic ornament
of early Christian art. In Scotland especially it is the commonest
decoration of a very remarkable class of monuments, more particularly
referred to hereafter, but of which it is sufficient meanwhile to say
that they do not occur, so far as I am aware, in any part of the Hebrides,
or in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, where the Scandinavian
influence was longest predominant in Scotland, and its relics are
still most frequently found. The suggestive source of the beautiful
interlaced patterns may be very naturally traced, as in the ornamentation
of the earlier pottery, to the knitting and netting of the primitive
industrial arts; nor is it at all necessary to assume that it was introduced
from Greece to the north of Europe, though it is found, to a
certain extent, common to both. But, indeed, many of the earlier
decorations of the Scandinavian Bronze Period are also to be found in
use by the Romans. The annular ornaments figured in the Guide
to Northern Archæology occur on almost every Anglo-Roman patella;
the spiral and double spiral ornaments are both frequently met with
on mosaics; and an urn, shewn in the same work, is surrounded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>one of the simplest varieties of the <i>frette</i>, a still more familiar classic
pattern.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> The only essentially characteristic ornaments of the arts of
the northern European races are the serpentine and dragon patterns.
In so far as these are not the obvious creations of fancy, they are
clearly traceable to an eastern source, the traditions of which, it will
be seen, are even more obvious in monuments of Scottish than of
Scandinavian art.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 543px;">
<img src="images/image446.jpg" width="543" height="469" alt="" />
</div>

<p>So much has been already said in reference to the legitimate conclusions
deducible from the various relics of primitive art, that it will
now suffice to indicate a few of the objects most characteristic of
this period. One of the most familiar of these is the snake bracelet.
Examples of it have been very
frequently found in Scotland, and
several very fine ones are preserved
in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries. The annexed
woodcut represents one of
these, weighing thirty-one ounces.
It was found at Pitalpin, near
Dundee, in 1732, and bears considerable
resemblance to another,
and still more beautiful one, found,
about the year 1823, among the
sand-hills of Culbin, near the estuary of the river Findhorn, Morayshire.
The circumstances attending the discovery of the latter are thus
narrated by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, in a communication which accompanied
a drawing of it exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland:&mdash;"Some
of the sand-hills of Culbin are a hundred feet in perpendicular
height; but the material composing them being an extremely
comminuted granite sand, is so loose and light, that, except in a dead
calm, it is in eternal motion, so that parts of the original soil are laid
entirely bare. Though flints are not included in the mineralogical list
of this country, yet there is one small spot among the sand-hills where
flinty fragments are often picked up; and as elf-bolts, or flint arrow-heads,
have been not unfrequently found on this spot, it is supposed that
a manufactory of those rude aboriginal weapons may have once existed
there. The finder having accidentally lost his gun-flint, went to the
spot to look for a flint to replace it, and in searching about he dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>covered
the antique."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> The weight of the bracelet is two pounds nine
ounces avoirdupois, and the form of the snake-heads, with which both
ends terminate, seems to indicate that they have been originally
jewelled. It can hardly be supposed that either of the above beautiful,
but ponderous ornaments, were designed to be worn on the wrist.
Such a weight would cumber the sword-arm of the most athletic hero;
and this is still further confirmed by the form of the example found
at Pitalpin, the inner edges of which are so sharp that they would
not only gall the arm, but would even be apt to wound it on any
violent action. Such ponderous bracelets were, in all probability,
honorary gifts or votive offerings, though there is also reason to believe
that they may have been regarded in the same light as the
Scandinavian sacramental rings previously referred to. A very remarkable
passage in illustration of this occurs in the Saxon Chronicle,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 876, where it is recorded that when the Danes made peace with
Alfred, at Wareham in Wessex, they gave him the noblest amongst
them as hostages, and swore oaths to him upon the holy bracelet.
(Halza Beage.)<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Examples, however, of bronze snake bracelets of
lighter weight, and evidently designed to be worn, are of more frequent
occurrence. In 1833 there were exhibited at a meeting of the Society
of Scottish Antiquaries, two bronze bracelets in the shape of serpents,
found in the district of Bunrannoch, Perthshire, on the northern declivity
of the mountain Schehallion. The
one weighed one pound two ounces, the
other, one pound fourteen and a-half
ounces avoirdupois, and they are described
as similar to the armilla found at Findhorn.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
Another example in the Society's
Museum, covered with verd antique, is a
light and beautiful bracelet, of the same
type, weighing only ten ounces.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/image447.jpg" width="431" height="511" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Among the earliest definite forms of
Northern art, the serpent or dragon is the
most common subject adopted for direct
imitation, or as a suggestive basis for the play of fancy, by the primitive
artist. The woodcut represents a singular bronze ornament in the Museum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>of the Scottish Antiquaries, the history of which is uncertain,
though its style of workmanship completely accords with that of other
well-known native relics. It is figured about one-third the size of the
original. The protuberances on the snake-formed bracelets and other
relics, evidently designed originally to represent the scales of the serpent,
appear to have latterly become a conventional ornament, and are
to be found on bronze relics unaccompanied by any more defined features
of the snake or dragon. The annexed woodcut represents a very
curious bronze relic in the Scottish Museum, whereon the triple snakelike
form and scales are represented,
but without the head
or any more distinct characteristic
of the reptile. It measures
five inches in its greatest
diameter, exclusive of the projecting
scale-like ornaments.
The exact locality where it
was found has not been noted;
but another example in the
same collection, a little smaller
in size, is believed to have been dug up in Argyleshire. It measures
externally four and four-fifths inches in greatest diameter. Its most
probable use is as a decoration of the arm, or possibly as a neck
ornament; but it is quite inflexible, and if worn on the neck must
have been permanently affixed to the inheritor of this cumbrous
badge of honour. The larger of the two, which is figured here,
weighs fully two pounds avoirdupois.</p>

<p>BRONZE BEADED TORC, (Lochar Moss.)<br />
and<br />
BROOCH OF LORN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of the commoner forms of torcs, head-rings, armlets, and other
personal ornaments of this period, examples are not rare in Scotland,
though the want of any efficient system for securing them from
destruction, when of the precious metals, or of being buried in
private collections and almost as effectually lost for nearly all useful
purposes, renders it difficult to obtain accurate accounts of the great
majority of discoveries. Some of the simpler bronze torcs and head-rings
have already been described among the relics of the Archaic
Period. But one of the most beautiful neck ornaments ever found
in Scotland is a beaded torc discovered by a labourer while cutting
turf in Lochar Moss, Dumfriesshire, about two miles to the north
of Cumlongan Castle; and exhibited by Mr. Thomas Gray of Liver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>pool
at the York Meeting of the Archæological Institute. It is
engraved on <i>Plate</i> III., along with the bronze vessel in which it was
inclosed. The beads, which measure rather more than an inch in
diameter, are boldly ribbed and grooved longitudinally. Between
every two ribbed beads there is a small flat one formed like the wheel
of a pulley, or the vertebral bone of a fish. The portion which must
have passed round the nape of the neck is flat and smooth on the
inner edge, but chased on the upper side in an elegant incised pattern
corresponding to the ornamentation already described as characteristic
of this period, and bearing some resemblance to that on the beautiful
bronze diadem found at Stitchel in Roxburghshire, figured on a subsequent
page. The beads are disconnected, having apparently been
strung upon a metal wire, as was the case in another example found
in the neighbourhood of Worcester. A waved ornament chased
along the outer edge of the solid piece seems to have been designed
in imitation of a cord; the last tradition, as it were, of the string
with which the older necklace of shale or jet was secured. Altogether
this example of the class of neck ornaments to which Mr. Birch has
assigned the appropriate name of Beaded Torcs, furnishes an exceedingly
interesting illustration of the development of imitative design,
in contradistinction to the more simple and archaic funicular torc,
which, though continued in use down to a late period, pertains to the
epoch of primitive art.</p>

<p>Various other personal ornaments have been discovered in Scotland,
manifestly belonging to this later era when artistic design had
been fully developed, and its works were characterized by a well-defined
style. Of one of the most remarkable of these a drawing has fortunately
been preserved, made to illustrate a communication to the
Scottish Society of Antiquaries in 1787, though the original, it is to
be feared, must no longer be sought for. The cairn in which the relic
was found is thus described: "At Cluinmore, near Blair-Atholl, there
is a beautiful green cairn, called Sithain-na-Cluana, <i>i.e.</i>, the Fairy Hill
of Clune. It is about twenty paces high obliquely, and about one
hundred and twenty paces in circumference. Upon the top of it
there are the two side stones of the altar still remaining, upon which
there are engraven some hieroglyphics, so much defaced that they are
not readable unless the stones were turned over and narrowly examined."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
A rough square outline is marked, "the urn, now open,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>1&frac12; ft. long;" and following it is the sketch, of which the annexed
woodcut is an exact copy, of the same size. It is described as the
"Large bronze ring found in the cairn of Clunemore." Rings of a
similar character to this, though differing greatly in their details, have
been frequently found in Denmark, and various fine examples are preserved
in the valuable collection at Copenhagen. But the most remarkable
feature of this very
curious relic is the hooded
snake's head which terminates
one of the ends, the
other having been most probably
finished in like manner.
It appears to have almost exactly
corresponded to those
on the large snake bracelet
found near Findhorn, and like
it seems to have been jewelled.
Objects of this class are
named by the Danish antiquaries, Rings for the Hair. A comparison
of this example, with one engraved in Mr. Thom's edition of Mr.
Worsaae's Primeval Antiquities, (p. 34,) will best illustrate their general
resemblance, and the very marked difference of their details. Whether
we assume it to have been designed as an ornament for the head or the
neck, the Clunemore ring, with its singular snake-head finials, could
not fail to prove a very striking article of personal adornment. Besides
these hair-rings, the Danish tumuli furnish numerous gold and
bronze bands, diadem and coronet shaped ornaments, and other head-dresses,
nothing similar to which are known in this country. Various
examples of these are engraved both by Lord Ellesmere and Mr.
Worsaae, including a very remarkable one figured in the Primeval
Antiquities, which was found a few years since in the neighbourhood
of Haderslev, and has an inscription engraved on the inner side, in Runic
characters, supposed to denote the name of the original possessor.
Other rings which occur among Scandinavian sepulchral deposits are
classified by Danish antiquaries among articles supposed to have been
connected with Pagan worship. These include several varieties of
penannular rings not greatly differing in general form from the British
gold relics already described under that name. But besides these
there are others of a much larger size, one of which, figured by Mr.
Worsaae, is described as "a large ring or girdle of massive gold
mixed with silver, which is rivetted together in the middle of the
front, and is conceived to have been the ornament of an idol; for it
can scarcely be supposed that any human being could have constantly
worn such a ring."<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Head-Ring. Roxburghshire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The woodcut represents an exceedingly beautiful bronze relic, apparently
of the class of head
rings, in the collection of the
Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland, which was discovered
in the year 1747, about
seven feet below the surface,
when digging for a well, at
the east end of the village
of Stitchel, in the county
of Roxburgh. It bears a
resemblance in some respects
to relics of the same
class in the Christiansborg
Palace, yet nothing
exactly similar to it has yet
been found among Scandinavian
relics; while some of its ornamental details closely correspond
to those which characterize the British horse furniture and
other native relics of this period. One of its most remarkable peculiarities
is, that it opens and shuts by means of a hinge, being clasped
when closed by a pin which passes through a double catch at the line
intersecting the ornament; and so perfect is it that it can still be
opened and secured with ease. It is probable that this also should
rank among the ornaments of the head, though it differs in some important
respects from any other object of the same class. The oval
which it forms is not only too small to encircle the head, but it will
be observed from the engraving that its greatest length is from side
to side, the internal measurements being five and nine-tenth inches
by five and one-tenth inches.</p>

<p>Montfaucon, Vallancey, and other continental and Irish antiquaries,
have traced the original of the lunar head-ornaments to the well-known
head-dress so common in Egyptian sculpture, and, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
out their favourite Druidical theories, have assumed them to be the
special badge of the Druid priests.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> There are not wanting, however,
traces of ancient customs among the races of Northern Europe which
would lead us rather to assign them as a part of female adornment,
as Mr. Birch has already done to the analogous gorgets, so nearly
resembling them in form.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The maiden coronet, or tire for the hair,
in use among the northern races of Europe, and its correspondence
to the snood or cockernonie of Scottish maidens, are very happily
illustrated in Mr. Robert Jamieson's notes to "Child Axelvold."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
One of the most touching passages of the old northern ballad derives
its chief beauty from the allusion to the ancient usage of the maiden
head-dress,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lang stuid she, the proud Elin&egrave;,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor answer'd ever a word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cheeks sae richly-red afore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grew haw as ony eard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She doffed her studded stemmiger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And will of rede she stuid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I bure nae bairn, sae help me God,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But and our Lady gude!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To <i>tyne her snood</i> is still a sufficiently intelligible phrase in Scotland
for the loss which forfeits the privileges of a maiden, without admitting
to those of a matron. The Greek poets also abound with
allusions to the nuptial ceremony of taking off the bride's coronet,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
and the Jews still preserve a similar usage; so that in this, as in so
many other northern customs, we recover additional traditions of the
Asiatic origin of the Teutonic races.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

SEPULCHRES OF THE IRON PERIOD.</h3>


<p>The descriptions already given of the circumstances under which
objects belonging to this era have been found, have supplied some
sufficiently characteristic illustrations of the sepulchral rites of the
period. Very few well-defined examples, however, of tombs of the
era immediately preceding the introduction of Christianity have yet
fallen under the notice of observers competent to furnish a satisfactory
report of their appearance, or of the peculiarities which have
marked the mode of interment in Scotland during this last Pagan
age. They are indeed comparatively rare, arising, in part at least,
from the period having been one probably of greatly shorter duration
than those which have been previously considered; but also we may
assume, from increasing civilisation having limited the sepulchral
honours of the cairn, or the huge barrow, with its costly deposits, to
a very few of the most distinguished chiefs. This latter conclusion
receives ample confirmation from many cists found without any
superincumbent heap, the contents of which, though of little moment,
frequently suffice to connect them with the age of iron. To those
tombs of this period, already referred to in previous chapters, one or
two additional examples of special interest, however, remain still to
be added. Lieutenant-Colonel Miller thus describes a discovery made
on his estate of Urquhart, Fifeshire, in the autumn of 1832:&mdash;"In
trenching the ground within about three hundred yards of Melford,
on the Eden, I came upon the remains of two cairns, adjoining which
was dug up a spear-head. It was under the root of a tree about an
hundred years old, about three feet under the surface, and is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
one of iron that I have met with." The spear-head, which is figured
here, measures, in its present imperfect state, only six and a half
inches long. The Colonel also describes a dagger, which had very
much the appearance
of a breakfast knife,
but was completely
oxidized. There was
dug up along with
these a small vase,
quite entire when
found, and in form somewhat resembling a tea-cup, but which was carelessly
left on the ground, and broken in the course of subsequent operations.
Besides this, several pieces of pottery were met with, one of the
thickest of which was strongly vitrified, and also a bronze fibula, and
a considerable quantity of bones and ashes.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> In another cairn, called
Gaskhill, near the village of Collessie, in the same county, there was
discovered, a few years since, an iron sword, now preserved at Kinloch
House. Though greatly corroded, its original form is still sufficiently
distinguishable. It measures fully eighteen inches in length, with
one edge, returned from the point a short way on the back; differing
in this respect from the pointless sword of the ancient Caledonian,
as described by Tacitus, though corresponding to other
examples found in Scotland, such as those already referred to, which
were discovered in the parish of Cummertrees, Dumfriesshire, in 1834.
In the course of the following year, a large tumulus on the farm of
Dasholm, near Garscube, Dumbartonshire, was partially demolished,
within which was a stone-chamber containing a bronze or copper relic,
described as the visor of a helmet, with a spear-head, the blade of a
sword, two small picks, and various other relics, all of iron, but concerning
the original use of many of which the discoverers could form no
idea.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The tumulus has been only very partially explored, and it is not
improbable that it may furnish equally interesting contents to some
future excavator. In 1836, another large tumulus was opened in the
neighbourhood of the Clyde Iron Works, Lanarkshire, which contained,
besides two cinerary urns filled with ashes, two bronze bridle-bits,
and various other relics, supposed to have formed portions of horse
furniture. The relics included in the latter class may justly rank
among the most interesting remains peculiar to the Iron Period.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 591px;">
<img src="images/image454.jpg" width="591" height="168" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>We know from the accounts of the Roman historians, that when
the invading army of Agricola was withstood by the united forces of
the Caledonians, one of their most formidable provisions for assailing
the legions was the native war-chariot. The incidents preserved to
us in the narrative of that memorable campaign of the Roman
general, furnish the chief historical evidence we now possess of the
degree of civilisation to which the native tribes of North Britain had
attained at the period when they came into direct collision with the
disciplined veterans of Agricola's army. But the most favourable
view of the progress then attained by the natives which can be
deduced from the allusions of classic historians, is amply borne out
by contemporary archæological evidence. The union of so large a
force under one native leader for the purpose of withstanding the
general enemy, is in itself no slight evidence of an advanced social
civilisation. We learn, moreover, that the British warrior had subdued
and trained the horse to his service, and was accustomed to
yoke it to the war-chariot; an ingenious and complicated piece of
workmanship, requiring no slight mastery of the mechanical arts to
execute.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most important characteristic of the last Pagan
era which the tumuli reveal to us; while we discover from them also
the remarkable fact, that in the sepulchral rites accorded to the most
honoured dead, not only the warrior's weapons, but even his chariot
and horses, were sometimes interred beside him, not improbably with
the idea that they might still suffice for his use in the strange Elysium
whither the thoughts of survivors followed their departed chief. The
horns of the deer, and other remains of the spoils of the chase, are
frequently found in the older tumuli, with also occasionally the
skeleton of the dog lying beside that of the hunter. But it is only
in this last period when we have reason to believe the Teutonic
colonists had brought with them to the British Isles many new arts
and customs, that we clearly trace the remains of the horse, or find
the relics of the war-chariot among the contents of the tomb, or beside
the urn.</p>

<p>The researches of the geologist establish beyond doubt that the wild
horse was a native of the British Islands prior to their occupation by
the earliest Allophylian colonists, and even prove the existence of
several species. "The best authenticated associations of bones of
the extremities, with jaws and teeth, clearly indicate that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>fossil-horse
had a larger head than the domesticated races; resembling in
this respect the wild horses of Asia described by Pallas."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> A smaller
species of <i>Equus</i>, the <i>Asinus fossilis</i>, is also found in the more recent
or diluvial formations, along with existing as well as extinct species.
Professor Owen remarks,&mdash;"From the peculiar and well marked
specific distinction of the primogenial or slender-legged horses, (<i>Hippotherium</i>,)
which ranged from Central Europe to the then rising
chain of the Himalayan Mountains, it is most probable that they
would have been as little available for the service of civilized man as
is the zebra or the wild ass of the present day; and we can as little
infer the docility of the later or pliocene species, <i>Equus plicidens</i>, and
<i>Equus fossilis</i>, the only ones hitherto detected in Britain, from any
characters deducible from their known fossil remains. There are
many specimens, however, that cannot be satisfactorily distinguished
from the corresponding parts of the existing species, <i>Equus caballus</i>,
which, with the wild ass, may be the sole existing survivors of the
numerous representatives of the genus <i>Equus</i> in the Europæo Asiatic
continent."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Whether any of the fossil species existed at the period
of earliest colonization in Britain is still open to question; but the
occasional discovery of teeth and bones of the horse, along with the
culinary debris of the Scottish weems and other primitive dwellings,
seems to indicate its existence here among the British Fauna prior to
its domestication and training for the Caledonian war-chariot.</p>

<p>A very curious discovery of the tomb of a British charioteer, with
the skeleton of his horse, was made in the year 1829, in the neighbourhood
of Ballindalloch, a small post-town in the county of Moray.
It is thus communicated in a letter to the secretary of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland:&mdash;"A labourer in digging for moor-stones
here, a few weeks since, on a moor about a mile from Ballindalloch,
found at a depth of above a foot from the surface, a quantity of
bones, among which appear to have been a human skeleton, and also
the skull and bones of a horse. The whole had been covered up, to
my great regret, before I heard of it; but the labourer tells me that
there were a quantity of rings and bits of iron, one of them like a
great hoop: but all completely rusted. I have been fortunate enough
to get hold of what I take to be the bridle [bit] of the horse, two
bronze rings, joined by a double link of iron, and also some bronze
rings which may have belonged to its harness. There were also some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>bits of wood, oak I find it to be from a fragment I have; but it was
all too much decayed to tell what it had been."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The letter is
accompanied with a sketch of what is described as "a curious little
iron cup found in the grave." It is shewn
in the annexed woodcut, and will be at
once recognised by the archæologist as
the umbo which formed the centre of the
shield, and received and protected the hand
of its wearer. The fragments of oak found
along with it may have also included part
of the shield, as well as portions of the war-chariot.
Scarcely a doubt can be entertained that in this discovery
we have one of the rare examples of the tomb of a British chief, with
his arms and his chariot and steed laid beside him,&mdash;a piece of wild
barbarian pomp which puts all the modern "boast of heraldry" to
shame. A bridle-bit in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
which answers closely to the above description, was found in 1822,
along with the remains of the horse and rider, about two feet below
the surface, in levelling May Street, in the New Town of Largs; and
was accordingly assumed as a relic of the celebrated battle fought
there with the Norwegian king, Haco, in 1263.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> It consists of two
plain bronze rings, measuring each three and three-quarter inches in
diameter, and united by a double link of iron.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 538px;">
<img src="images/image457.jpg" width="538" height="474" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Independently of the great interest which justly attaches to the
British war-chariot, as an evidence of skill and of considerable progress
in civilisation, the horse furniture which usually accompanies
it furnishes one of the most illustrative class of relics of the artistic
skill of the period. Among these the bridle-bits have most frequently
attracted attention. The examples found in Scotland differ in no
very remarkable degree from those with which the archæologists both
of England and Ireland are familiar. They consist generally of two
large bronze rings, united by two or sometimes three links of the
same metal. They are frequently highly ornamented, and the marks
of later repair observable on many of them suffice to shew the great
value attached to them. The beautiful example figured here, was
found about the year 1785, in the bottom of a deep moss at the east
end of Birrenswork Hill, Dumfriesshire, a locality rich in the remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>of Roman and British arts, and where the traces both of Roman and
native intrenchments are still visible. The outer diameter of the rings
of the bridle-bit measures two and seven-tenth inches, and the ornamental
appendages projecting into each ring still retain considerable
traces of the red and blue enamel with which they have been filled.
It must have been made for a small horse, as the centre piece measures
somewhat less than two inches within the perforated loops. It
appears to have been long in use. The large rings are much worn,
and have been ingeniously repaired by rivetting a new piece to each.
The small loops or eyes also attaching them to the bit have had a
fresh coating of metal superadded where they were partially worn
through.</p>

</div>

<p>A remarkable discovery of ornaments, bronze rings, bridle-bits, and
other portions of horse furniture was made in a moss at Middleby,
Annandale, in the year 1737. The whole of these were secured by
the zealous Scottish antiquary, Sir John Clerk, and are still preserved,
along with numerous other objects collected by him, at Penicuick
House. The bridle-bits, though plainer than the one figured above,
are of the same type, and one of them corresponds to it in the want
of uniformity of the two rings, which is probably to be accounted for
from their being designed for a pair of charioteer's horses, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
ornamental ring being designed for the outside, where it would be
most exposed to view. The duplicate of this appears, from a note in
the handwriting of Sir John Clerk attached to the example still preserved
at Penicuick House, to have been presented by him to Mr.
Roger Gale. Drawings of the principal objects of this valuable collection
were forwarded to the Society of Antiquaries of London at the
time of their discovery, by Sir John Clerk, and are still preserved.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
One or two of the most remarkable objects found at Annandale are
figured here from the originals at Penicuick House. They are nearly
identical in type with the collection of antiquities found within the
extensive intrenchments at Stanwick, on the estate of the Duke of
Northumberland, and since presented by His Grace to the British
Museum. Some of the principal
objects are engraved in
the York volume of the Archæological
Institute, the
Stanwick relics having been
exhibited during the Congress of 1846. Another discovery of nearly
similar character was made at Polden Hill, Somersetshire, in 1800.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
These also have been secured for the British Museum, and correspond
with the Annandale bridle-bit, figured above, in the beauty of their
enamel as well as in the form and ornamental details of many of the
articles. The great beauty of these objects and the amount of decoration
expended on the horse furniture, prove at once the high state
of the arts at the period to which they belong, and also the wealth
and luxury of the people, which enabled them to lavish such costly
ornamentation even on their harness and the furnishings of their war-chariots.
No account is known to have been preserved of the circumstances
attending the interesting discovery at Middleby, but the
place where they were found precludes the idea of their having belonged
to a sepulchral deposit. By far the most ample notice we
possess of one of the latter, affording a valuable illustration of the
precise use of the objects of antiquity described above, as well as of
the rites and customs of their owners, occurs in an account of the
opening of some barrows on the Wolds of Yorkshire, communicated
to the Archæological Institute by the Rev. E. W. Stillingfleet, Vicar
of South Cave, in that county. The following account of the contents
of one of these, which proved to be the sepulchre of a British
charioteer, is abridged from Mr. Stillingfleet's interesting narrative.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The elevation of the barrow was uncertain, from its crown having being levelled;
its diameter was from eight to nine yards. The cist was nearly a circle of
eleven or twelve feet. In this cist, excavated to the depth of about a foot and a
half in the chalky rock, and on a nearly smooth pavement, the skeleton of a British
charioteer presented itself, surrounded by what in life formed the sources of his
pride and delight, and no inconsiderable part of his possessions. The head of the
charioteer was placed to the north with an eastern inclination. He rested on his
back, his arms crossed on his breast, and his thigh and leg-bones appearing to have
been crossed in opposite directions. Very near to his head were found the heads of
two wild boars. Inclining from the skeleton, on each side, had been placed a
wheel; the iron tire and ornaments of the nave only remaining. In diameter the
wheels had been a trifle more than two feet eleven inches. The diameter of the
ornaments of iron, plated with copper, which had encircled the nave as a kind of
rim, was very nearly six inches. Each of the wheels had originally rested on a
horse, the bones of which were found under or adjoining to them; the head of each
horse being not far from that of the charioteer on opposite sides. From the size of
their leg-bones these horses were of unequal height, but probably neither of them
reached thirteen hands."</p></div>

<p>In the charioteer's cist were also found the bridle-bits, rings, buckles,
and others of the metallic furnishings of the harness. Many of these
objects closely correspond to those found both at Stanwick and in the
Middleby Moss, leaving no room to question their native origin and
workmanship, and thus freeing us from any uncertainty apparent in the
communication by Sir John Clerk to the London Antiquaries, who
has thus cautiously labelled his drawings,&mdash;"Horse-furniture found in
a moss in Annandale in Scotland, <i>supposed to be Roman or old Danish,</i>
<i>or British</i>!" The chariot and horses, as well as the personal orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>ments
and weapons of war, deposited beside the buried chief, were no
mere idle funeral pomp, but destined for his use in a future world.
Doubtless his faithful attendants anticipated, when lavishing such
costly rites on his sepulture, that they were furnishing them for his
entrance into the Valhalla of the Gods, proudly borne in the chariot
in which he had been wont to charge amid the ranks of the enemy,
and achieve such deeds of valour as form the highest attainments of
barbarian virtue. It is to be remarked, however, that the articles
found in the Yorkshire barrows differ from those discovered in Annandale,
in being of iron plated with copper; whereas the latter
appear to be entirely formed of bronze, and perhaps should, on this
account, be assumed to be of a somewhat earlier date; unless, as is
fully more probable, they mark a period when the use, or the full
knowledge of the working of iron, was very partially diffused throughout
the British islands, and when, therefore, the older and more
familiar metal was still to be looked for among the more northern
tribes.</p>

<p>It is obvious, from the various examples already cited, that much
diversity existed in the modes of interment practised in Scotland
during the last heathen period. The cairn and tumulus, the cist and
cinerary urn, all occur accompanied with contemporary relics. The
Danish antiquaries are able to refer to a definite period when cremation
was abandoned for inhumation. But if the date assigned by Mr.
Worsaae for the close of the Danish Bronze Period be correct, it very
nearly corresponds with that of the introduction of Christianity into
Scotland, when our later Iron Period came to a close. Perhaps it is
to this closing period of the Pagan era that we shall most consistently
refer the substitution of the earliest forms of rude oaken coffins for
the primitive cist of stone. Mr. Worsaae has described the investigation
of a remarkable barrow in 1827, at the village of Vollerslev, containing
a cist hollowed out of a very thick oaken stem, about ten feet
in length, within which was found the remains of a woollen mantle, a
sword, dagger, palstave, and brooch of bronze, a horn comb, and a
round wooden vessel with two handles. English archæologists are
familiar with a corresponding oaken cist brought to light a few years
since, on the opening of a tumulus at Gristhorpe, near Scarborough,
within which lay a skeleton, and beside it a bronze spear-head, flint
javelin and arrow heads, ornaments of bone, and a small shallow
basket of wicker-work. The whole of these interesting relics are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
deposited in the Scarborough Museum. So far as this single example
goes, it rather tends to connect the remarkable deposit with a much
earlier period. It is referred to in Mr. Thom's interesting preface to
the English edition of the Primeval Antiquities of Denmark, as, with
one exception, the only discovery of the kind known to have taken
place in England. Probably, however, such examples are less rare
than is supposed. They have already been observed in more than
one instance in Scotland, though little calculated to excite interest in
the minds of those under whose observation unfortunately such discoveries
most frequently come. On the removal of a tumulus, a few
years since, on the estate of Cairngall, in the parish of Longside,
Aberdeenshire, two such oaken cists were exposed. They are thus
described by Mr. Roderick Gray:&mdash;"One of them was entire; the
other was not. They had been hollowed out of solid trees, and measured
each seven by two feet. The sides were parallel, and the ends
were rounded, and had two projecting knobs to facilitate their carriage.
The bark of the trees of which they had been formed remained on
them, and was in the most perfect state of preservation. No vestige
of bones was found in either of them. They had been covered over
with slabs of wood, and lay east and west."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> A more remarkable
ancient sepulchre of somewhat similar character was discovered in the
parish of Culsalmond, in the same county, in the month of May 1812.
The following account of it is furnished by the Rev. F. Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In preparing a field for turnips, the plough, at a spot from which a large cairn
of stones and moss had been removed about thirty years before, struck against
something which impeded its progress. On examination this proved to be a wooden
coffin of uncommon size, and of the rudest conceivable workmanship. It had been
formed from the trunk of a huge oak, divided into three parts of unequal length,
each of which had been split through the middle with wedges and stone axes, or
perhaps separated with some red-hot instrument of stone, as the inside of the different
pieces had somewhat the appearance of having been charred. The whole
consisted of six parts,&mdash;two sides, two gables, a bottom, and a lid. Only a small part
of the lid remained, the greater part of it having been splintered and torn up by
the plough. The coffin lay due east and west,&mdash;the head of it being in the east
end of the grave. The sides were sunk into the ground thirteen and a half inches
below the bottom piece. In the middle of them were grooves of rough and incomplete
workmanship, and of the same length at the bottom. The projecting parts of
the sides rested on a hard substance much mixed with ashes which had undergone
the action of a very strong fire, and on which part of the grave had evidently been
erected the funeral pile. In a corner of the coffin was an urn which was broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>in the digging out. It had been formed of a mixture of clay and sand; narrowest
at bottom, very wide at the top, and about ten or eleven inches deep. After the
different pieces were placed in the grave in their proper order, it appears to have
been surrounded with a double row of unhewn stones."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p></div>

<p>It was my good fortune to witness the exhumation during the present
year of examples of this remarkable class of oaken cists, under
circumstances of peculiar interest. In the course of constructing an
immense reservoir on the Castlehill of Edinburgh for supplying the
city with water, an excavation was made on this, the highest ground,
and in the very heart of the ancient capital, to a depth of twenty-five
feet.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> After removing some buildings of the seventeenth century
and several feet of soil, in which were found various coins of the
Charleses and of James VI., a considerable portion of a massive stone
wall was discovered, which there can be little doubt formed part of
the defences of the city, erected by authority of James II., exactly
four centuries before: <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1450. Lower down, and entirely below
the foundations of the ancient civic ramparts, the excavators came
upon a bed of clay, and beneath this a thick layer of moss or decayed
animal and vegetable matter, in which was found a coin of the Emperor
Constantine, thus suggesting a date approximating to the beginning
of the fourth century. Immediately underneath this were
two coffins, each formed of a solid trunk of oak, measuring about six
feet in length. They were rough and unshapen externally, as when
hewn down in their native forest, and appeared to have been split
open. But within they were hollowed out with considerable care, a
circular space being formed for the head, and recesses for the arms;
and indeed the interior of both bore considerable resemblance to what
is usually seen in the stone coffins of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
They lay nearly due east and west, with the heads towards
the west. One of them contained a male and the other a female
skeleton, unaccompanied by any weapons or other relics, but between
the two coffins the skull and antlers of a gigantic deer were found, and
alongside of them a portion of another horn, artificially cut, and most
probably the head of the lance or spear with which the old hunter armed
himself for the chase. The discovery of such primitive relics in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>very heart of a scene of busy population, and the theatre of not a few
memorable historical events, is even more calculated to awaken our
interest, by the striking contrast which it presents, than when found
beneath the lone sepulchral mound, or exposed by the chance operations
of the agriculturist. An unsuccessful attempt was made to remove
one of the coffins. Even the skulls were so much decayed that
they went to pieces on being lifted, but the skull and horns of the
deer found alongside of them are now deposited in the Museum of
the Scottish Antiquaries. It is not altogether unworthy of notice
here, as possibly indicating the Celtic origin of this early substitute
for the primitive stone cist, that our term coffin appears to be derived
from the Gaelic, <i>cobhan</i>, a coffer or wooden chest; Greek, &#954;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;, a
wicker-basket or coffer, though the more usual modern Gaelic name
applied to the coffin is <i>ciste-mairbh</i>, or chest of the dead.</p>

<p>The great diversity in the later heathen sepulchral rites may be
traced with much probability to the causes which have suggested the
term Teutonic as most applicable to the period immediately preceding
the introduction of Christianity. The isolation of the British
Celtæ was at an end. Not only were the Teutonic races of the Continent
effecting numerous settlements in the British Isles, and falling
back on the more northern and purely Celtic tribes, as they were
compelled to give way to the inroads of the Roman legions on their
earlier scenes of colonization; but even where the Celtic population
maintained their ground, we have abundant evidence that very extensive
intercourse with the south was familiarizing them with the arts
and civilisation of the continent of Europe. Such intercourse could
not fail also to introduce to them many novel rites and superstitions
such as are still traceable in the folk-lore of the whole Teutonic races.
Numerous independent proofs unite in confirmation of the fact of an
entirely new era having taken the place of the early Bronze Period.
The uses and relative values of the metals had obviously been finally
adjusted. The Scottish bridle-bit shews the adaptation of the iron
for use and the bronze for ornament; and this is even more apparent
in the plated harness of the British charioteer found on the wolds of
Yorkshire. All the evidence concurs in shewing how great was the
change that had taken place since the primitive metallurgist laboriously
fashioned his weapons from the rare and costly bronze, still
supplying numerous deficiencies with implements of horn and stone.
The variety, moreover, in the sepulchral deposits, and in the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
of objects designed for the same purpose, is no less indicative of the
important changes superinduced on primitive arts, than are the various
modes of sepulture suggestive of a diversity of national customs
and creeds, or of the indifference and scepticism which are the forerunners
of change. Everything betokens the close of the long Pagan
era which we have followed down from that remote dawn of archæological
annals in which we catch the first dim traces of the aboriginal
Briton mingled among alluvial relics of strange animal life, to the
commencement of authentic written history and inscriptions, preparatory
to a new period of which our own century forms a part.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;HISTORICAL DATA.</h3>


<p>By whatever course the earlier colonists of the British Isles reached
our shores and diffused the first influences of the presence of man, as
well as those succeeding evidences of his progress, the traces of which
have been reviewed in the preceding sections, it is unquestionable
that that latest and most important of all sources of change, the introduction
of Christianity, took place by a very different route from
that of the Straits of Dover. All the affinities indicated by the
later and well-defined relics of native art point to a more intimate
intercourse and community of customs and arts between the natives
of Scotland and Ireland than between those of the northern and
southern parts of the island of Great Britain, taking as its natural
intermediate boundary the Highlands of Northumberland and Cumberland.
South of this the tribes partook of the characteristics of
those of the neighbouring continent. They shared in the civilisation
of the north of Europe, held by its mythology, and were involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
its enslavement by the aggressive expansion of the overgrown Roman
empire; while the nations both of northern Albany and of the Irish
isle were left to the unmitigated influences, for good or evil, of their
wild independence. The geographical position of the British and Irish
coasts sufficiently accounts for frequent intercourse between the natives
of Scotland and Ireland from the earliest periods. While the
narrowest part of St. George's Channel has a breadth of about sixty-five
miles, the opposite coasts of the Mull of Cantyre and of Fair Head
in the county of Antrim, are only fourteen miles apart. The remarkable
ancient historical Gaelic poem, generally termed the ALBANIC
DUAN, written in its present form in the reign of Malcolm Canmore
about the middle of the eleventh century, thus refers to the first
peopling of Scotland and the Irish origin of the northern Picts:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Of the history of the neighbouring island during the first centuries
of the Christian era our knowledge is necessarily extremely imperfect
and uncertain; nor have the over-zealous exertions of Irish antiquaries
to clear up this period of their national annals greatly added
to our information. Without, however, entering upon the controverted
ground of primitive Irish history, it is sufficient for our present
purpose to know that at the period of the introduction of Christianity
into Ireland it was occupied by the Hiberni, an ancient if not
aboriginal Celtic race, by the Cruithne, as the inhabitants of Ulster
are called by the native annalists, and also by the Scoti, a race who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
had then apparently established themselves in Ireland, and secured a
complete supremacy over the elder native population, at no very distant
date. Whencesoever this latter race was derived, we have evidence
that they were considerably advanced in civilisation, though
their superiority appears to have been less in arts than in arms, the
traces of early artistic skill being generally ascribed on satisfactory
grounds to the older races who acknowledged their supremacy.
So effectual was their superiority in arms, however, in effacing
every trace of the independence and nationality of the more ancient
tribes, that towards the close of the third century at the latest, the
name of Scotia appears to have been generally applied to Ireland,
and for nearly seven centuries continued to indicate the Hibernia of
Latin writers.</p>

<p>Christianity had already gained some partial footing in Ireland
prior to the apostolic mission of St. Patrick, who was consecrated for
that purpose by Pope Celestine, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 433. Both the parentage and
country of the Irish apostle have been made the subject of recent
controversy, but, according to the most commonly accepted history,
the little village of Kilpatrick, on the north bank of the Clyde, between
Glasgow and Dumbarton, claims the honour of having given
birth to the patron saint of Ireland; in return for which the Scottish
apostle, St. Columba, is acknowledged as of Irish origin. Though
Ireland was not unknown to the Romans no attempt appears to have
been made to subject it to their grasping sway, and it was accordingly
left to reap by indirect means the advantages of southern civilisation.
This the introduction of the new religion most effectually
promoted. Greek and Roman literature received the attention of the
clergy in a way that produced far more direct and beneficial results
than any which flowed from the intrusion of Roman civilisation and
supremacy into the neighbouring island. A native literature was developed
and fostered, native arts sprung up, and architecture assumed
a peculiar national character. From the middle of the fifth till
nearly the close of the eighth century, Ireland was among the most
civilized and prosperous of the nations of Europe, and wanted only a
native Alfred or a Canmore to give the same unity to its independent
tribes which St. Patrick had conferred on its ecclesiastical state.</p>

<p>It was during this prosperous era, in the very beginning of the
sixth century,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> that a small colony of these Irish Scoti effected a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>settlement in the district of Scotland now known as the county of
Argyle, and conferred on it the name of Dalriada, according to
spurious monkish traditions, in honour of their leader, Cairbre
Riada, a celebrated Scottic warrior whose epoch is assigned by older
Irish annalists to the third century. This, however, was certainly
not the first interchange of races between Scotland and Ireland, nor
did it exercise any immediate influence on Scottish history. The
earliest authentic records succeeding the era of Roman invasion exhibit
Scotland divided into the kingdoms of the Cruithne, or Northern
Picts, and the Piccardach, or Southern Picts. The Irish Cruithneans
were doubtless a Celtic colony originally from Scotland. Early
writers agree in recognising both by the same name of Picts, though
few subjects have excited more fruitless controversy than the attempts
to assign historic consistency to the half-fabulous race of Scottish
Picti, or even to agree on the derivation or meaning of their name.
The <i>nec falso nomine Picti</i> of Claudian was long assumed as decisive
of their being mere naked savages, who decorated their bodies with
paint. But this error is now generally abandoned. A more consistent
derivation may be sought in the Welsh <i>peith</i>, <i>to scream</i>, <i>to</i>
<i>fight</i>, whence <i>pic-t-a</i>, <i>fighting man</i>. In accordance with such a derivation
it appears to have been common to more than one native
tribe or kingdom, and to have been rarely or never used unaccompanied
by some distinctive epithet, such as the <i>Gwyddyl Ffichti</i>, or
Gaelic Picts of the Welsh Triads.</p>

<p>Into the long disputed question of the origin of the Pictish race,
it is happily no longer needful to enter at large. Much learning and
acrimony have been expended on it, not altogether without reason;
for its proper understanding involves the consistent resolution of
that period, of no slight importance in Scottish history, intervening
between the year 296 of our present era, when the first mention
of the Scottish Picti occurs,<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> and the intrusion of the Saxon race
in the eleventh century into the kingdom of the Southern Picts. To
the critical researches of one or two recent writers, and especially to
the consistent narrative of Skene in his able work on the Highlanders
of Scotland, we owe the rescue of this portion of Scottish
history from the confusion and mystery to which monkish legends
and modern controversy had consigned it. During this important
era which intervenes between the final retreat of the Romans and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>the accession of Malcolm Canmore, we find North Britain divided
into the three kingdoms of the Northern and Southern Picts and
the Dalriads. The Irish derivation of the latter being undoubted,
further research into their origin has been left to Hibernian antiquaries,
while our native writers long sought in vain to discover any
clue either to the intrusion or extrusion of the Pictish race, which if
distinct from the old Celtic population, must have appeared and disappeared
like the winter's snow. By some they have been supposed
to have been utterly eradicated by successive invaders, or to have
gradually disappeared as a distinct race by marriage and intermingling
with their supplanters. Others have maintained that the Northern
and Southern Picts were two distinct races, of which the latter
alone were exterminated or driven from the soil by the successive
invasions of the Lowlands, while the former maintained their ground,
which is still possessed by their descendants the Scottish Highlanders.
The weight of evidence, however, and the manifest coincidence between
the ancient topographical nomenclature throughout the whole
of Scotland, leave no room to doubt that both the Northern and
Southern Picts, who have long formed a mythic and half-fabulous race
in the popular traditions of Scotland, were none other than the original
Celtæ, who so resolutely withstood the Roman invaders. Ptolemy
gives the names of thirteen Caledonian tribes; in some editions of the
Old Geographer the number is extended to seventeen; and to these
the questionable authority of Richard of Cirencester adds at least
four more. In all probability the greater number of these existed as
independent and frequently rival tribes, up to the period of Roman
invasion, and were for the first time united under one leader or chief
when Galgacus led them against the legions of Agricola. The immense
host, however, which he brought into the field, shews that
Scotland was then no longer a savage and thinly-peopled country,
while their war-chariots, their shields, huge iron swords, and other
effective accoutrements, have already been referred to in evidence of
the progress which they had then made in the useful arts. This
union against a common enemy, maintained as we have good reason
for believing it was, throughout the whole period of the Roman occupation
of Scotland, was perhaps the most important of all the fruits
which Scotland reaped from the intrusion of the civilized Romans;
and to it we may with much probability ascribe the permanent coalition
of the numerous independent tribes, and the consequent estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>lishment
of the two Pictish kingdoms, the limits of which were to a
great extent determined by the natural features of the country. Both
spoke dialects of the same Celtic language, to which the philologist
still turns for explanation of the more ancient name of Lowland as
well as Highland localities, and which still exists as a living tongue
among the Scottish Gael. In the Welsh Triads, which are believed
to be fully as old as the sixth century, the Picts are uniformly designated,
without distinction, as the <i>Gwyddyl Ffichti</i>, that is the Gaelic
or Celtic Picts; and Bede, in enumerating the different languages in
which the gospel was taught in Britain, speaks of the <i>lingua Pictorum</i>
as one tongue, though it is apparent elsewhere that he was familiar
with the distinction between Northern and Southern Picts. Even
Ritson, while fiercely opposing the idea of any community of origin
between the Caledonian Britons and the Picts, admits that the language
of the latter was a Celtic idiom.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> They were in fact the descendants
of the only primitive Scottish race of which we possess any
authentic historical evidence: the Albiones of Festus Avienus; the
race of Albanus of the "Albanic Duan;" the Albanich of Welsh and
native writers; and the most numerous and powerful representatives
of a people which we have reason to believe continued exclusively to
occupy the British Islands from a period the commencement of which
we must seek in those dim unchronicled centuries we have already
attempted to explore, down to the fifth or perhaps the fourth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Then began what we should call the Teutonic Invasion, and the
long quiescent Celtæ once more renewed their old nomadic life. Yet
the lapse of so many centuries has not sufficed to efface the ancient
characteristics by which we still recognise as one race the Cornish,
Welsh, Gaelic, and Irish Celtæ.</p>

<p>Of six modern Celtic dialects still recognised in Europe, four belong
to the British Isles. A fifth, the Cornish, now extinct, also
pertained to the same insular home of the &#922;&#8051;&#955;&#964;&#945;&#953;, while the only remaining
one, the Armorican, or dialect of Brittany, belongs to a
country intimately associated in the history of its early colonization
with Britain. The table of the modern Celtic dialects of Europe, as
modified by Dr. Charles Meyer, and adopted by Dr. Latham,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>that given by Dr. Prichard in his "Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations,"
is as follows&mdash;divided primarily into two great dialects, each
composed of three separate idioms:&mdash;</p>


<ul class="index"><li class="isub1">I. <span class="smcap">The Gallic or British.</span><br /></li>

</ul>

<p>But a new race of strangers acquired a footing in Scotland, who
were destined to bear no unimportant part in its history. The colony
of Irish Scoti, or Dalriadic Scots, having effected a settlement in the
district of Argyle, continued to occupy this limited locality for upwards
of three hundred years, without seeking to extend their possessions
beyond the natural boundaries which inclose the Western
Highlands. To this period we may with little hesitation assign many
of the traces of ancient population, civilized arts, and extensive cultivation,
which have been described in a former chapter.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> A close intercourse
appears to have been always maintained between the Scottish
Dalriads and their Irish progenitors, and the history of the Dalriadic
kingdom is still chiefly derivable from Irish annalists. From these
we are led to conclude that the number and influence of the Dalriadic
Scots had gradually increased, while the attention of the Northern and
Southern Picts was chiefly engrossed by their own rival jealousies;
but their position was frequently precarious, and for nearly three
centuries they owed their safety fully as much to the natural isolation
of their little kingdom, as to the dissensions of the Picts and the
fidelity with which the Irish Scoti adhered to this colonial offshoot
from the parent stock. The cooperation and alliance of the Dalriads
at length became objects of consideration to these neighbouring
rivals, and we learn of a union between the Scots and the Northern
Picts, entered upon in the year 731, for the purpose of supplanting
Angus MacFergus, a Southern Pict, who then occupied the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the Cruithne and their allies were completely worsted, and
for upwards of eighty years the larger portion of the kingdom of
Dalriada appears to have been subjected to the rule of the Southern
Picts. There is abundant evidence, however, that the Irish Scoti
continued to maintain a close intercourse with their Dalriadic descendants,
and made common cause with them against the Piccardach.
The Irish annals occasionally afford the only evidence we now possess
of the wars then waged between Scots and Picts, by recording the
death of their native kings and chiefs, slain in Albany when fighting
with their Dalriadic kindred. But for this powerful aid, it is difficult
to conceive how the Dalriads could have held their ground within the
small territory which they occupied, in opposition to a powerful kingdom
united under one sovereign, even with all the skilful tact with
which they availed themselves of the jealousies and rivalry existing
between the northern and southern tribes. The struggle between the
Dalriads and Picts assumed latterly in some degree the character of
a war of succession. There is reason to believe, from several of the
names of the Dalriadic kings, that they had not failed to strengthen
their alliances with the Northern Picts by intermarriage, so that it is
not improbable, owing to the peculiar Celtic ideas of succession by the
female line, that the Dalriads may have acquired a claim to the Pictish
throne. There appears, however, not only to have existed lines of
hereditary sovereigns, succeeding according to the peculiar Pictish
laws of succession to the supreme rule, but also a hereditary <i>nobile</i>
<i>genus</i>, or patrician class, holding as tenaciously by the purity of their
blood and lineage, as under the most stringent rule of the lyon kings-at-arms
of a later age.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Much obscurity still rests on this period of
our national history. Partially and at intervals we discover glimpses
of the struggle then going on, amid which, however, increasing evidences
suffice to shew that fortune favoured the Dalriadic Scots,
until in the year 843 the whole of Scotland is found united under the
sceptre of Kenneth MacAlpin, originally sovereign of the little kingdom
of Dalriada.</p>

<p>This is that remarkable epoch in our national history known by the
name of the Scottish Conquest. It has naturally formed the subject
of much investigation and of still more debate. Our earlier historians,
assuming the results to have corresponded with the term Conquest,
attribute to Kenneth the total extermination of the Piccardach or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
Southern Picts; the consequence of which has been, that later and
more accurate writers, seeking in vain for any evidence of so complete
a revolution, have been inclined to pronounce the whole a fable. But it
still remains for us to inquire if no other elements of friendly alliance
and permanent union existed between the Picts and Scots than those
which sprung from cooperation against a common foe. A tradition of
a Spanish origin appears to have been ascribed to the Irish Scoti from
the earliest period. It is interwoven into all the fables and monkish
legends of our earlier chroniclers, and has already been alluded to in
reference to the Lia Fail. It is now perhaps vain to attempt to analyze
this obscure and doubtful tradition, though we are not without evidence
of its probability.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The period of their arrival in Ireland is necessarily
very partially ascertained, though our information is perhaps
sufficiently authentic and minute if we assume, from the notice of
Avienus, already referred to, that they were unknown in Ireland in
the fourth century before Christ, while we have good evidence of their
presence there at the period of Julius Cæsar's British invasion. During
this interval history furnishes very satisfactory means of accounting
for such a migration. In the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 218, the second and fiercest
struggle between the rival republics of Carthage and Rome was commenced
by Hannibal taking Saguntum, a town on the eastern coast
of Spain. The Peninsula thereafter became the theatre of a war afterwards
carried by Hannibal into Italy, which was not concluded till
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 202, when Spain was added to the growing empire of the Italian
Republic. But the natives of Spain did not willingly bow to the yoke.
One of the bloodiest of all the Roman wars commenced in Spain <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
153, and did not finally terminate for twenty years, during which
cities were razed to the ground, multitudes massacred and made slaves,
and the triumphant arms of Rome borne to the Atlantic shores. Here
therefore is an epoch in the history of the Spanish peninsula which
seems completely to coincide with the ancient traditions of the Scoti,
and the knowledge we possess of the period of their arrival in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>Such coincidences are not of course to be accepted as absolute proof;
but in the absence of more direct evidence they are well worthy of
attention, as guiding us to some knowledge of that race which had
acquired a footing in Ireland, and partially displaced the aboriginal
Hiberni shortly before the Roman invasion of England. But we have
still the evidence of philology, the prevailing topographical nomenclature
of Ireland, and the dialects of its earliest native literature, all
adding confirmation to the conclusion that the Scoti were only another
branch of the great Celtic family, which, after enjoying the
advantages of commercial intercourse with Ph&#339;nicia and Carthage,
and sharing in the civilisation of the distinguished nations then bordering
on the Mediterranean, had at length been driven forth from
their settlements on the western shores of Spain by the encroachments
of the Roman Republic. The brief and very partial presence of a
Scandinavian race in Scotland is still traceable in its dialects and topographical
nomenclature; but no such indications within the limits
of the ancient Dalriada, or in the Erse as contrasted with the British
dialects of the Celtic language, betray indications of the Irish Scoti
having interfused any elements of a foreign tongue into the ancient
language of the Scottish Gael. Assuming, therefore, their Celtic origin
we can readily understand how a race speaking a cognate dialect, and
seeking the shores of Ireland, not as invaders, but as refugees, might
rapidly acquire the supremacy over the older Celtic races inferior to
them in the arts of war. Such a superior Celtic race were no less fitted
to become the colonists and chiefs of Caledonia; and to this consanguinity
between the Irish Scoti and the Scottish Picts, which rests
more on philological evidence than on any theory of the direct origin
of the former, we must look for one of the most important elements
in that remarkable revolution of the ninth century known as the
Scottish Conquest. The subdivisions of the great Celtic family are of
much more importance in relation to the early history of the British
islands, and especially of Scotland, than the later Teutonic migrations.
There are, first, two great subdivisions, arising apparently from the
different routes by which the Celtæ migrated from Asia to the north-west
of Europe; and secondly, there are the minor subdivisions,&mdash;of
greater importance in their bearing on the present inquiry,&mdash;resulting
from successive arrivals in this country of offshoots from both the great
streams of migration, modified by previous sojourn in different countries
of Europe, and probably also by some intermingling with foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
races. Thus, the Cruithne and Piccardach, or Northern and Southern
Picts of Scotland, are frequently distinguished by the Welsh chroniclers
as the <i>Gwyddyl duon</i> and the <i>Gwyddyl gwyn</i>, or <i>black</i> and <i>fair Gaels</i>.
Perhaps the term <i>Du-Caledones (Di-Caledones)</i>, by which the Romans
distinguished the Northern from the <i>Vecturiones</i> or Southern Picts, is
only a combination of the Celtic <i>du</i> or <i>dubh</i>, black, with the generic
name adopted by them. The Scoti appear also to have been <i>of the</i>
<i>fair race</i>, which may, perhaps, be assumed as the indication of a purer
Caucasian origin than the Cruithne or <i>Gwyddyl duon</i> of the north.
They are termed in the Welsh Triads the <i>Gwyddyl coch</i> or <i>Red Gaels</i>;
while the name of <i>Scot</i>, which has adhered to them and to the later
country of their adoption, is none other than that of Nomade, <i>Scuta</i>,
wanderer, first applied to the refugees&mdash;as we conceive from Spain&mdash;who
in the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> sought a new home amid the Irish
Celtæ.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> It is to be noted, however, in reference to the former appel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>lations,
that both the Scots and Irish were wont to distinguish the
Scandinavian invaders by the name of <i>Dubh-Ghaill</i>, the black strangers,&mdash;a
term derived not from their complexion but their costume.</p>

<p>The presence of a Pictish race&mdash;the Cruithne&mdash;in Ireland, contemporary
with the Scottish Piccardach and Cruithne, and the very great
correspondence between many of the gold and bronze relics, as well as
the older architectural and monumental antiquities of Scotland and
Ireland, all point to a very close intercourse maintained between the
two countries at an early period, while the remarkable historical poem,
the Albanic Duan, already quoted, assigns to the Cruithne of Scotland
an Irish origin. Under such circumstances the occupation of Dalriada
by a Scotic colony speaking a dialect of the same language as the
Caledonian Picts would be too unimportant a change to excite any
notice beyond the limits of the Western Highlands. The native tribes
whose borders were encroached upon would settle their disputes according
to the summary diplomacy of primitive courts; and that done,
intercourse, alliances, and intermarriages would follow as naturally between
Scots and Picts as between Piccardach and Cruithne. So, in
like manner, when the Scots in alliance with the Cruithne or Northern
Picts conquered the Piccardach or Southern Picts, it was merely transferring
the supremacy to a more powerful branch of the same great
Celtic family. There existed few of the causes for lasting or deadly
feud which occur in the struggle for power between rival races, such
as the Moors and Goths of Spain, or the English and Irish. The
struggle in England between the Normans and Saxons owed its chief
elements of bitterness to other causes, as is proved by the readiness
with which the two races intermingled when they met on common
ground and on an equal footing in the Scottish Lowlands, under Malcolm
Canmore. Aided by the very summary processes adopted in
rude periods for getting quit of the elements of a disputed regal succession,
the lapse of a single generation would suffice to obliterate the
animosities between Scot and Pict, and to establish the former in undisputed
possession of such supremacy as the Normans had to compel
and to maintain for several generations in England, at the point of
the sword. Perhaps it formed another element of interfusion among
the various Celtic races that the supremacy of the Scoti was solely as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>warriors. The old native race are always referred to by the Irish
bards as superior to them in the knowledge of the arts; a fact perhaps
sufficiently accounted for on the presumption of their arrival in Ireland
as refugees, after a protracted strife extending over more than
one generation, during which the refined arts and luxuries of civilisation
would disappear in the struggle for existence. This also may in
some degree account for the fact that the Scoti allied themselves
with the inferior and most dissimilar race in Scotland, compelled thereto
obviously by the superiority of the Piccardach or Fair Picts. But
the superior race finally triumphed. The Scoti, indeed, with the aid of
the Cruithne, gained the ascendency; but on the extinction of the
Scotic line of princes descended from Kenneth MacAlpin, or on the
transference of the crown to a collateral branch, according to ancient
Pictish law, it seems to have returned to the fair race of the Piccardach.
The ultimate ground of dispute between the two, which proved
the chief stumblingblock, and prevented a complete union of the
southern and northern kingdoms during the reign of the Scottish dynasty,
was this Celtic idea of succession through brothers, in opposition
to the hereditary succession aimed at by the Dalriadic race, and
which was not so effectually forced on the Northern Picts even by the
Saxon Conquest as to prevent its revival by Donald Bain, on the death
of Malcolm Canmore in 1093. The concluding stanzas of the <i>Albanic</i>
<i>Duan</i>, written in the early part of Malcolm's reign, are peculiarly characteristic
of the revived claims of the <i>Gwyddyl duon</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Malcolm is now the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of Duncan of the yellow countenance,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But though a variety of evidence seems to refer to the Scoti as inferior
in arts to the native Irish, it is still probable that Ireland
owes to them the introduction from the southern seats of European
civilisation of some of the useful and ornamental arts, the traces
of which are so abundant throughout the island. It is, however,
chiefly to their undoubted superiority in arms over the kindred races
that previously were in possession of the ancient kingdoms both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
Hibernia and of Albany, that we must ascribe the singular and almost
unparalleled occurrence of the conquerors transferring their own
name to the whole race and country subject to their rule.</p>

<p>Such is a hasty glance at the most important events pertaining to
the civil history of Scotland during the first centuries of the Christian
era, with an attempt to account for some of the changes that have
heretofore seemed most difficult to reconcile with ascertained facts.
But other and no less remarkable changes were, meanwhile, being
wrought on the native tribes of Caledonia. The legionaries of Rome
had in vain attempted to penetrate into their fastnesses; but other
Roman missionaries of civilisation followed with more abundant success.
Towards the latter end of the fourth century, ere yet the little
kingdom of Dalriada had a being, a youth, the son of a British Prince
of Cumberland, visited Rome during the Pontificate of Damasus,
elected Bishop of Rome, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 366. Young Nynias, or Ninian, remained
there till the succession of Siricius to the Popedom, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 384, who,
according to Bede, finding the young Briton trained in the faith and
mysteries of the truth, ordained him, and sent him as a Christian
missionary to preach the faith to the heathen tribes of North Britain.
This is the celebrated British Bishop St. Ninian, or St. Ringan, as he
is more frequently styled in Scotland, where numerous churches,
chapels, holy wells, as also caves and other noted localities, still
bear his name. Arriving in Britain towards the close of the fourth
century, he tarried not among his native mountains of Cumberland,
but crossing the Solway, established the chief seat of his mission
at Whithern, in Wigtonshire, a prominent headland of the old province
of Galloway, where he erected the celebrated <i>Candida Casa</i>,
according to Bede, "a church of stone, built in a manner unusual
among the Britons."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The fact is of great value, as disproving the
assumption of both Scottish and Irish antiquaries, prior to Dr. Petrie,
that the earliest British churches were constructed of wattles. The
remains of Roman buildings in Scotland suffice to shew that the Britons
of the fourth century had not then to learn, for the first time, the art
of masonry, though the facilities offered by a thickly wooded country
frequently led the first Christian missionaries to employ its oak and
plaited reeds in the construction of their chapels and cells. We are
told by Bede that the first church of Lindisfarne was built by St.
Finan, <i>more Scotorum, non de lapide, sed de robore secto et arundine</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>The brethren of Iona, too, as Adomnan incidentally mentions, were
challenged by the proprietor, from whose lands they had gathered
stakes and wands for the repair of their dwellings. Yet notable as
the cathedral church of Whithern doubtless was, we can have little
hesitation in picturing it to our own minds as a sufficiently humble
and primitive structure, though distinguished among contemporary
edifices, and dear to us in no ordinary degree, as the first British
temple consecrated to the rites of the true faith. The Candida Casa,
or white-walled cathedral of Whithern, though dedicated originally to
St. Martin,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> became the shrine of the Scottish apostle St. Ninian, and
the resort of many a royal and noble pilgrimage, down even to the
Reformation; but it would be vain now to look for any relics of this
most interesting primitive structure on the bold headland of Galloway,
though the fragments of a later ruined chancel still mark the site
of St. Ringan's famous shrine.</p>

<p>The death of the primitive Scottish Bishop St. Ninian took place
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 432. According to the accepted biography of St. Patrick it was
in the following year that Pope Celestine consecrated him a Bishop,
and sent him on his mission to Ireland. But the labours of the
Scottish missionary had not been in vain. "The brethren of St.
Ninian at Whithern" became the centre of an important movement,
influencing a large and rapidly increasing sphere, and from their
labours there is reason to believe that both England and Ireland received
the first impressions towards that great movement which ultimately
included the British Isles within the ecclesiastical unity of
papal Christendom. It furnishes no inconclusive evidence of the
progress of the new faith in the British Isles, that St. Palladius was
sent from Rome to the Christian Scots, towards the middle of the
fifth century, for the purpose of uprooting the Pelagian heresy. His
chief mission was to Ireland, where the Scots were then settled, but
he also cared for the converts of the neighbouring isle, then connected
with Ireland both by frequent intercourse and by affinity of races. He
personally visited the Christian Picts of North Britain, and despatched
his disciple St. Servanus, or St. Serf, as he is more usually styled, to
the Northern Islands, for the purpose of preaching the true faith to
the natives of Orkney and Shetland. That he also was successful
many local names and traditions, and even some ecclesiological relics,
hereafter referred to, suffice to prove, and thus we arrive at the impor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>tant
fact, that Christianity had already established a firm footing, both
in the Scottish mainland and the isles, long before we have any evidence
of the presence of the Scandinavians, even as roving marauders, on
our coasts. The value of this will be at once apparent, as shewing the
necessity which authentic history imposes upon us of referring to a
period long anterior to the intrusion of the earliest Scandinavian colonists
into Scotland, the erection of the monolithic structures, memorial
cairns, and other primitive monuments, which fanciful theorists have
assigned, without evidence, to such foreign origin. It is uncertain
how long St. Palladius was in Scotland, but his last days were spent
there, and he died among his Cruithnean converts at Fordun, in
<i>Mag-girgin</i>, or the Mearns. We find good evidence that the influence
of his preaching was not evanescent. Before the end of the fifth
century churches had been founded, and brotherhoods of priests established,
both in the islands and on the mainland; and Bede relates
that, in the beginning of the eighth century, while yet the Dalriadic
Scots remained within the narrow limits of their first possessions in
the Western Highlands, the Pictish king sent to his own monastery
of Jarrow, craving that builders might be commissioned to construct
for him a church of stone after the Roman manner. From this we
are led to infer that the "mos Scotorum" referred to by Bede, of
building both houses and churches of timber and wattles, was also the
"mos Pictorum" of the same period; but Dr. Petrie has already conclusively
established the fact that this custom prevailed only to a very
limited extent in Ireland, and contemporarily with the erection of religious
structures of so substantial a nature that characteristic examples
of them still remain in sufficient preservation to shew perfectly what
they had been in their original state. It is indeed from Adomnan's Life
of St. Columba that Dr. Petrie produces the earliest historical authority
which satisfactorily proves the erection of a round tower in the
sixth century.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> We search in vain for such primitive ecclesiastical
structures in Scotland, or even for the stone churches which Boniface
and other Italian builders, sent at King Nectan's desire, are said to
have built at Invergowrie, Tealing, and Restennet in Angus, at
Rosemarky in Ross, as well as in other parts of the kingdom of the
Northern Picts. Yet it will be hereafter seen that we are not without
some evidence of the character of primitive Scottish churches
"built after the Roman manner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the primitive Christian missionaries referred to as bringing
tidings of the new faith to Scotland, St. Rule, St. Adrian, St.
Woloc, St. Kieran, and St. Kentigern, must each be noted as sharing
in the good work. But the religious establishment which <span class="smcap">St.</span>
<span class="smcap">Columba</span> founded at Iona, in the middle of the sixth century, is justly
regarded as the true centre of all the most sacred and heart-stirring
associations connected with the establishment of Christianity in
Scotland. "That illustrious island, which was once the luminary of
the Caledonian regions," still awakens feelings in the mind of every
thoughtful visitor, such as no other Scottish locality can give birth
to, unless a Scotsman may be pardoned if he associate with it, not
"the plain of Marathon," but the field of Bannockburn. We look in
vain for any natural features in this remarkable island to account for
its selection as the centre of primitive Christian missions in Britain.
It is only about two and a half miles in length, and one in breadth.
The waves of the Atlantic dash, with almost unceasing roar, against
the rugged granite cliffs which guard its southern and western coasts;
and but for the memory of its sacred historical associations, and of
its ancient magnificence which has utterly passed away, there is nothing
about the little island, placed far amid the melancholy main,
that could now tempt the most curious traveller to approach its shores.
St. Kieran, the favourite Celtic saint, was the precursor of St. Columba,
and even it is said his instructor in the faith. He came from
Ireland in 503, with the sons of Ere, thus celebrated in the Albanic
Duan as converts of St. Patrick,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sons of Erc, son of Eathach the prosperous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The three who obtained the blessing of Saint Patrick."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cave of St. Kieran is still shewn in Kintyre, where the first Christian
teacher of the Western Highlands is believed to have made his
abode. If the dates of this remote era may be relied on, it was not
till upwards of half a century after the arrival of St. Kieran, that the
great Apostle of Scotland landed on its shores. The record of Bede
is equally simple and precise,&mdash;"Anno <span class="smcap">DLXV</span>. Columba presbyter de
Scotia venit Brittaniam ad docendos Pictos, et in insula Hii monasterium
fecit." The isolation of that little island might perhaps be
thought to have proved an attraction to Colum M'Felim M'Fergus,
when he abandoned Ireland in his rude <i>currach</i>, or boat of hides, and
sought an asylum among the Scottish Picts. But the old Celtic traditions
seem rather to indicate, that in the true missionary spirit he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
bearded the ancient faith in its stronghold, and reared the primitive
Christian fane of Iona, where of old the Pagan circle had stood. The
name of Hii, or I, by which the sacred isle is most generally known,
signifies emphatically <span class="smcap">The Island</span>. It is also familiar to us as Ii-Cholum
Chille, or the Island of Columba's Cell; but the Highlanders,
to the present day, frequently apply to it the name of <i>Innis nan</i>
<i>Druidheanach</i>, or the Island of the Druids, or magicians. The first
structure reared by St. Columba and his followers on Iona, was
doubtless as humble as the little <i>currach</i> by which they had reached
its shores. One curious passage, already referred to, speaks of the
Abbot as sending forth his monks to gather bundles of twigs with
which to build their Hospice. The little chapel of St. Oran, the first
follower of St. Columba who found a grave in the sacred soil, still
exists, and has been frequently described as a work of the sixth century,
but the experienced ecclesiologist will feel little hesitation in
dating it full six centuries later. It is not indeed at such spots as
Whithern or Iona that we are to look for the existence of primitive
structures. The veneration which made these the favourite resorts of
pilgrims for many centuries, was little likely to permit the first homely
fane to continue, at a period when the re-edifying of churches and
monasteries, on a larger and more magnificent scale, was one of the
readiest exponents of the piety or contrition which the Church inculcated
on its disciples. If any of the primitive Scottish churches still
exist, they must be looked for in localities less favoured by the fidelity
of medieval piety or superstition.</p>

<p>Christianity we thus perceive was established in Scotland at a very
early period, altogether apart from any contemporary intercourse
which England may have maintained more directly with the converts
of the neighbouring continent. Several important centres were fixed
at various points, including the extreme south-west of Scotland,
the remote northern, and the western Isles. From these the faith
rapidly radiated to the whole surrounding regions, and was even
carried by the youthful zeal of the new converts to distant shores.
The Icelandic Sagas furnish abundant proof of the conversion of the
natives of North Britain and Ireland long prior to Scandinavia, and
of the direct influence which they exercised in the Christianizing of
the north. When Norsemen first visited Iceland in the latter half of
the ninth century, it was uninhabited, but they discovered traces of
the former presence of Irish monks, and found their books, crosiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
and bells. This account, derived from the Sagas, receives independent
confirmation from the narrative of Dicuil, an Irish monk of the ninth
century, who states that monks from Ireland had resided in Iceland
for six months, and also visited the Færo Islands, and found them
uninhabited.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> There also existed in ancient times a church in Iceland
dedicated to St. Columba, and a native Icelander is described as
having been educated by an abbot named Patrick, in the Western
Isles of Scotland or Ireland. We likewise find in the names of
several of the northern Scottish Islands, and in the traces of the
dedications of their earliest churches, ample confirmation of their
inhabitants having been Christianized prior to any Scandinavian
settlement. The islands of North and South Ronaldshay are now
distinguished by their relative positions, but their ancient names are
<i>Rinansey</i> and <i>R&ouml;gnvalsey</i>. Professor P. A. Munch, of Christiania,
adds in a letter referring to this subject,&mdash;"I have no doubt that the
name of the island, before the Scandinavian settlement, was
St. Ninian's Island, Ringan's Island, Ronan's Island, which involves the
Christianity of the ancient Celtic population before the Norwegian
settlement." It is not, however, with Scandinavian antiquaries that
we have to contend in clearing up these points of national history,
but with British writers, who vainly seek the sources of native arts
and civilisation in those of nations younger than our own. Mr.
Worsaae acknowledges that Ireland was Christianized several centuries
before Scandinavia, and largely contributed towards the conversion
of the latter to the new faith. Interesting traces still remain
in the names of many Scottish localities of the primitive Christian
colonies, and of the collegiate establishments founded, like that of
Iona, in many of the northern and western Isles, several of which are
mentioned by Adomnan in his Life of St. Columba. In the curious
diploma addressed to Eric, king of Norway, respecting the genealogy
of William Saint Clair, Earl of Orkney, drawn up by Thomas Tulloch,
bishop of Orkney, about 1443,&mdash;wherein, for the sake of brevity, he
lets pass many "notable operationis and gestis, and referrs ws till
auld cronikis and genealogiis, autentik and approbat," the following
notice occurs: "Sua we find that in the tyme of Harald Comate,
first king of Norwege, this land, or contre insulare of Orchadie, was
inhabitat and mainerit be twa nations callit <i>Peti</i> and <i>Pape</i>, quhilk

These were undoubtedly the native Celtic population, or Picts&mdash;of
the total extermination of whom a document of the fifteenth century
cannot be regarded as very conclusive evidence&mdash;and the Papæ or
ecclesiastical fraternities sent forth from Iona. In the Life of St.
Columba it is stated, that the Saint chancing to meet a prince of the
Orkneys at the palace of King Brude, commended to his care some
monks who had lately sailed to the Northern Seas, and the missionaries
afterwards owed their life to his intercession.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The Landn&aacute;ma
states, that wherever the Norwegian settlers found monks, or
remains of their establishments, they called the places by some name
beginning with Pap, from <i>pfaff</i>, <i>Papa</i>, &#960;&#8049;&#960;&#960;&#945;&#962;, a priest,&mdash;as <i>Papey</i>,
the Priest's Island; <i>Papuli</i>, the Priest's district. In Orkney there
are two <i>Papeys</i>; the larger Papa Westray, the smaller Papa Stronsay.
In the mainland also there is Paplay, (<i>Papuli</i>); another Paplay in
South Ronaldshay; in Shetland two <i>Papeys</i>, Papa Stour and Papa
Little; and a Papill (<i>Papilia</i>) in Unst. In the Hebrides also there
are two <i>Pabbys, (Papey,)</i> and a <i>Pappadill</i> in Rum. Adomnan mentions,
besides his own monastery, those of Achaluing, Himba, Elanna-oma,
and Kilduin; the three last supposed to be Oransay,
Colonsay, and Loch Awe. Eig, Islay, Urquhart, Inchcolm in the
Frith of Forth, Govan on the Clyde, and many other religious sites,
are also ascribed, on more or less trustworthy authority, to the missionary
zeal of St. Columba, and his immediate followers; while a
still earlier origin is assigned, not without some evidence, to various
of the ancient Culdee Houses reformed by David I., or merged by
him in the magnificent monastic establishments which he founded.
Great as was the influence of the Northmen in retarding the fruits of
early missionary zeal, it is obvious that they rarely so effectually
despoiled the Christian establishments as to permanently eradicate
them, or break the traditional sanctity which has consecrated their
sites to the service of religion even to our own day. Iona, burned in
802, was rebuilt in 806. Sixty-eight of the brethren perished by the
hands of the Pagan Northmen the same year: yet in 814, we again
find them founding and building. It is impossible, therefore, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>avoid the conclusion that Christianity was very extensively diffused
throughout North Britain, and that numerous ecclesiastical fraternities
had been established on the mainland and surrounding islands long
before the natives learned to watch the horizon for the plundering
fleets of the Norse rovers.</p>

<p>It is not till the ninth century that we find authentic traces of the
Scandinavian Vikings on the Scottish shores. While, however, we
regard the Pagan Northmen in the light of lawless spoilers, preying
on weaker or defenceless neighbours, we must beware of the error of
supposing that they were no more than a barbarian race of pirates.
On the contrary, they speedily substituted conquest for spoliation
both in Scotland and Ireland, colonized the possessions they acquired,
and established trade and commerce in lieu of robbery. They bore,
indeed, no slight resemblance to the bold adventurers of a more
civilized age, who followed Drake and Raleigh in their reprisals
against Spanish America, and won reputation, still honoured in our
naval annals, by means as inconsistent with the modern law of
nations as the plundering expeditions of these old Scandinavian
Vikings. The war-songs of the Northmen shew that such expeditions
were the paths to honour as well as to wealth; nor was it till
the milder tenets of Christianity had superseded the warrior-creed of
Thor, that their plundering voyages came to an end. But unlike
the British and Irish, the Scandinavians have a Pagan literature,
contemporary with those scenes of adventure and bold deeds of arms:
and so much the more valuable that it preserves a picture of the
period uninfluenced by that corporate spirit which detracts so much
from the contemporary monkish annals of our own and other countries.
They had their <i>sagaman</i>, and their bard or <i>skjalde</i>, like the
minstrel or troubadour of medieval Europe, whose chief business
it was to rehearse the Sagas, and to compose songs and odes in commemoration
of their victories and individual prowess. We must not,
therefore, rob the old Pagan Norseman of the wild virtues of his age
and creed, by bringing them to the standard of modern ideas and
principles; but rather accept the characteristic picture of his Sagas
as furnishing no unlikely portraiture of the hardy Caledonian warrior
of an earlier age.</p>

<p>We know little that is definite regarding the Scandinavian expeditions
to our shores till Harold Harfager, king of Norway, in the
latter part of the ninth century, conquered first the Zetlands and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the Orkney Islands and Hebrides, and made himself master of the
Isle of Man. The change from having the Norsemen as plunderers
to that of having them as masters, was probably altogether beneficial,
though not unaccompanied with much violence and suffering. Previously
to this period, their ravages appear to have been incessant,
and very frequently successful, both on the Scottish and Irish coasts.
They repeatedly assailed and plundered the Christian community of
Iona; and the annals of Ulster record that the Gentiles, as they are
usually termed, completely spoiled the establishment in the year
802, and expelled the family of Iona from the sacred Isle. They
seem to have treated in a like manner the various religious communities
settled on the different islands above referred to, and still
commemorated in the old Scandinavian names which they conferred
on them; though, as has been shewn, the followers of St. Columba,
and no doubt other fraternities, speedily rebuilt their establishments.
Even at that early period, some amount of wealth would be accumulated
in the muniment chests of the monasteries, and doubtless the
poorest of them would endeavour to provide the chalice, paten, and
other indispensable furniture of the church and altar, of the precious
metals. These must have supplied a fresh incentive to the plundering
Vikings, and thus the early incursions of the Northmen largely
contributed to retard the diffusion of the faith among the native
Britons, while their own divisions and internal struggles furnished frequent
opportunities for the unchecked descent of the spoilers on their
coasts. Nor was it plunder alone that the fierce Northmen bore
away from our shores. Both the Irish annals and the Icelandic
Sagas testify to the fact, that they frequently loaded their vessels
with captives, both male and female, who were sold elsewhere for
slaves. There even appear to have been regular markets in Norway
and Sweden where the captive Scots and Picts were disposed of, and
some of the names still in use in Iceland are believed to be derived
from such foreign captives: the female slave having occasionally won
the favour of her master, and been wedded even to leaders and kings.
While, however, the Norse marauders were making descents with
increased frequency on our shores, a revolution was taking place in
Norway, somewhat akin to that which placed the Dalriadic chief on
the Pictish throne. Harold Harfager, after a protracted struggle,
established himself as absolute king of Norway; and such of the
Vikings as had been active in opposing his ambitious projects could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
no longer winter in safety within the <i>viks</i> or inlets of their indented
coast, from whence they derive their name. Many of these, therefore,
who had before paid occasional visits to our shores, now established
their head-quarters in the Scottish Hebrides, the numerous
bays and inlets of which afforded the shelter and protection for their
long-oared galleys formerly sought in their native fiords. From
this <i>point d'appui</i> they made incessant incursions on the newly-established
kingdom of Norway, while they failed not also to harass
and spoil the neighbouring Scottish coasts. Thus deprived of any
settled home, and without an acknowledged leader, the Vikings
assumed more than ever a piratical character, and became the terror
of the whole north of Europe. King Harold failed not to offer effectual
resistance to these rebellious Norsemen. Every summer the Norwegian
fleet scoured the Scottish Seas, and compelled them to abandon
their Hebridean settlements; but the hardy Vikings had little to
fear from assailants who only drove them to the open sea, from
whence, after a successful descent on some unguarded coast, and not
unfrequently on that of their assailant, they returned in winter to
the shelter of their old retreat.</p>

<p>After repeated expeditions of the same fruitless character against
the rebellious Vikings, King Harold determined to put an end to
their predatory incursions by making himself master of the islands
which afforded them shelter. Accordingly, in the year 875, he collected
a powerful fleet, which he commanded in person, and setting
sail from Norway, he bore down on the Shetland and Orkney Isles
and the Hebrides, slaying or driving out the piratical Vikings, spoiling
their settlements, and taking possession of the islands. He then
proceeded to the Isle of Man, which he found entirely deserted of its
inhabitants, who had fled to the Scottish mainland on the approach of
the fleet. Harold failed not to enrich his followers with the spoils of
the Scottish coasts as they returned from this successful expedition,
so that the unhappy natives were exposed to equal dangers
from the Vikings and their Norwegian conquerors. They were
not, however, reduced to abject fear by such repeated assaults.
Harold bestowed the possession of the Northern Isles on Sigurd, the
brother of Rognwald, a distinguished Norwegian chief, who accordingly
became first Jarl of the Orkneys; and the fleet returned to
Norway, leaving a force deemed sufficient to secure the newly conquered
possessions. But the native chiefs of the islands and neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>ing
coasts who had been spoiled and driven from their possessions by
the Vikings, took advantage of their dispersion, and so soon as the
Norwegian fleet had left the Scottish seas, they seized possession of
the Hebrides, expelled or put to the sword the whole of the Norwegians
left by Harold to hold them in his right, and resumed the
occupation of their ancient possessions. A second Norwegian expedition
followed under the guidance of Ketil, a distinguished chief,
on whom Harold bestowed by anticipation the title of Jarl; and it
is curious that in the "Islands Landnamabok," the natives who had recovered
possession of the islands are termed Scottish and Irish Vikings,
(<i>Vikinger Skotar ok Irar</i>,) sufficiently shewing the sense in which that
term was understood by the Northmen in the beginning of the twelfth
century. The Islesmen were unable to resist the overwhelming force,
and appear to have been taken entirely by surprise. The Hebridean
Jarl entered quietly into possession of his new dominions, and then
took the first favourable opportunity of renouncing his allegiance to
Harold and declaring himself independent King of the Hebrides.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to do more than glance at the subsequent history
of the Scoto-Norwegian kingdoms. In 894, Thorstein the Red,
the grandson of Ketil, formed a close alliance with Sigurd, then jarl
of Orkney, and with their united forces they made themselves masters
of the northern districts of Scotland, including Caithness, Sutherland,
Ross, and Moray. Sigurd lost his life in this expedition in a remarkable
manner. Having, according to the narration of the Ynglinga
Saga,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> slain Melbrigda T&ouml;nn, or Maolbride the Bucktoothed, one of
the Scottish maormors or chiefs who derived his appellation from a
peculiarly prominent tooth, he cut off the Maormor's head and hung
it at his bridle. But from the violent motion as he galloped over the
field, the tooth inflicted a wound on his leg, which inflamed, and ultimately
caused his death. The record of this incident in contemporary
sagas may suffice as an illustration of the barbarous warfare
of the period. Sigurd was succeeded by his son Guttorm, as Jarl of
Orkney, while Thorstein the Red assumed the title of king of the
newly acquired possessions on the mainland; and thus within half a
century after the Dalriadic king Kenneth had obtained possession of
the throne of the Southern Picts by the aid of the Cruithne or Northern
Picts, a large portion of the possessions of the latter were wrested
from them and erected into a new kingdom under their foreign con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>queror.
The sovereignty of Thorstein, however, was of brief duration.
He had scarcely held his newly acquired territories for six years when
he had to take the field to oppose a force collected by the chiefs of
the conquered possessions, under the command of Duncan, the maormor
of Caithness. A fierce battle ensued, in which Thorstein was
slain, his followers completely routed, and the Norwegians expelled
from the Scottish mainland. This took place <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 900, and for nearly
a century no farther aggression was attempted by the Norwegians, with
the exception of the annexation of a part of Caithness to the Orkney
jarldom, the result, as is believed, of an alliance between Thorfinn,
the Orkney jarl, and the daughter of Duncan, maormor of Caithness.
In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 986 Sigurd, jarl of Orkney, once more conquered the north of
Scotland, after having defeated Finlay, son of Ruari, maormor of
Moray, in an attempt to recover Caithness from its Norwegian possessors.
Frequent battles followed. The Norwegians were repeatedly
defeated and driven from the mainland: but they returned with increased
force and re-established their ground. Meanwhile, by the
defeat and death of Kenneth M'Duff, Malcolm, maormor of Moray,
became king of Scotland <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1004, and soon after effected a reconciliation
with Sigurd, jarl of Orkney, and gave him his daughter in
marriage. Thus a mixture of Norwegian and Scottish blood took
place, the fruit of which is still discernible in the striking contrast
between the population of the northern islands and Scottish mainland
and the Celtic races of the neighbouring Highlands.</p>

<p>Alternate friendly alliances and open warfare followed till <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1034, when the Norwegians once more triumphed and obtained effectual
possession of the greater part of the north of Scotland, where
they established a kingdom under the powerful and talented Jarl
Thorfinn, the son of Sigurd and of his wife, the daughter of the Scottish
king Malcolm, who thereby ultimately acquired a hereditary right
to the Scottish crown, similar to that which is believed to have paved
the way to the previous accession of the first Dalriadic king of Scotland.
We have thus reached a period of Scottish history over which
modern literature has thrown a fictitious but singularly romantic interest.
The lineal race of Kenneth MacAlpin, the Dalriadic king,
having become extinct, the succession reverted to Duncan the son of
Crinan, a powerful chief who had married the daughter of the last
king of the Scottish race. But the old Celtic ideas of succession
proved irreconcilable with his assumption of the crown, and the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>sonal
character of Duncan was little fitted to cope with the difficulties
of his situation. His unambitious spirit indeed prevented his forcing
himself into collision with the Norwegians, or disputing with Thorfinn
his newly acquired dominions; and had he been able to communicate
the same disposition to his subjects, his reign might have terminated
in peace. But after enjoying his throne for about six years, his people
took advantage of the absence of Thorfinn on an expedition to England,
and putting him at their head, forced their way into the district
of Moray with little opposition. But the Pictish natives of the north
refused to recognise the right of Duncan to the crown, or to accept
him as a deliverer from the Norwegian yoke, and headed by Macbeth,
the maormor of Moray, they attacked him in the neighbourhood of
Elgin, routed his army and put him to the sword. Macbeth pursued
his success, made himself master of the whole kingdom, and with the
sanction of the Norwegian jarl assumed the title of King of Scotland.
Thus strangely were the questions of regal legitimacy and national
independence at variance. It appears to have been solely as a tributary
to Thorfinn that Macbeth reigned over the southern half of
Scotland. Repeated unsuccessful attempts were made by the adherents
of Duncan's party to recover possession of the throne for his son.
In one of these, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1045, Crinan the father of Duncan was slain, who
is styled in the Annals of Ulster "Abbot of Dunkeld,"&mdash;lay impropriation
and the marriage of the clergy having both been common in
Scotland prior to the reform of its church by the Saxon princess who
became the wife of Duncan's son. The expedition of Duncan had
been undertaken while Thorfinn and the chief Norwegian forces were
engaged in assailing the Saxon possessions in England. The sons of
Duncan accordingly sought refuge at the English court; and when
Malcolm Canmore, Duncan's eldest son, returned to avenge his father's
wrongs, he was accompanied by a Saxon army under the command of
his uncle, Siward Earl of Northumberland. In securing by such
means the possession of the Lothians, which was all that Malcolm
was able at that time to wrest from Macbeth, he paved the way for
that second and most important change, known in Scottish annals as
the Saxon Conquest. Four years afterwards Macbeth was defeated
and slain in the battle of Lumphanan, and on the death of Thorfinn,
in 1064, Malcolm Canmore obtained final possession of the entire
Scottish mainland, though the Norwegian jarls continued to retain
undisputed hold of the Northern and Western Isles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is a slight sketch of that important era in Scottish history;
from the intrusion of the Scottish race into the Western Highlands,
to the final ejectment of the Norwegians from the Scottish mainland,
and the restoration of the crown to a Celtic prince at the head of a
Saxon army. It is impossible to conceive of the presence of Norwegian
settlers for so long a period on the mainland of Scotland without
their greatly affecting the character of the native population. From
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 895, when the first Norwegian kingdom was established in the
north of Scotland, to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1064, when that of Thorfinn came to an end
at his death, a very large portion of the north of Scotland had been
repeatedly held possession of for a considerable period by the Norwegians.
Long periods of peace and friendly alliance afforded abundant
opportunities for intermarriage; and we see in the marriage of
the Orkney jarl with the daughter of the Scottish maormor, a clear
proof that no prejudices interfered to prevent such unions. This was
still less likely to be the case during the reign of Macbeth, which
lasted for eighteen years, as the closest alliance and community of
interests then subsisted between the Northern Celtic and Norwegian
races, and to this period therefore we probably owe the chief changes
on the aboriginal Scottish race which still distinguish their descendants
from the purer Celtic races of the south and west of Ireland.
The genealogies of many of the old Highland chiefs, and the history
of the clans, furnish evidence of this intermixture of the races; and
the physical characteristics of the natives of several northern districts
of the Scottish Highlands abundantly confirm the same fact. Yet it
is surprising how very partial the influence of the Northmen must
have been. We have proofs of the introduction of Runic literature,
and also of the use of Runic characters by the natives; yet if we
except the Isle of Man, a dependency of Scotland both before and
after its occupation by the Northmen, we have only the merest fragments
of inscriptions in the northern runes found in Scotland. On
the mainland some few local names are traceable to a Scandinavian
origin. In the Scottish Lowland dialect a considerable number of
words and many peculiarities of pronunciation are manifestly derived
from the same source; while in the Orkney and Shetland Isles, customs,
superstitions, language, and even legal formulas, all clearly
point to their long occupation as an independent Norse jarldom, or
as a dependency of the Danish crown. In the Western Isles, however,
it has proved otherwise. There the language and race are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
purely Celtic, and the ancient topographical nomenclature has been
but slightly affected from their occupation by the Vikings and their
Scandinavian successors. This is probably to be accounted for to a
great extent by the fact, that the Hebrideans, like the natives of Man,
fled on the occupation of their islands by the pirate Norsemen, and
only very partially returned after the establishment of law and order
under Ketil, the independent Norwegian jarl; so that these islands
have been to a great extent colonized anew from the neighbouring
mainland. Still extensive and durable traces remain to commemorate
the intrusion of this race of northern warriors on the older colonists
of Scotland, nor can we hesitate to ascribe somewhat of our peculiar
national character and physical conformation to that intimate intercourse
which prevailed more or less extensively for nearly two centuries,
and indeed in the Orkney and Shetland Islands for a much
longer period, between the Norwegian and Celtic races. On Scotland,
as a whole, the influence of this Scandinavian colonization and conquest
has been much more direct and effective than any results of the
Roman Invasion. But both of these historic changes suffice to account
for only a very few of the national peculiarities, or of the distinctive
features of our earlier arts, and still require us to look to native
sources for the larger number of archæological relics, and for the most
characteristic classes of monumental remains.</p>

it may be observed that the Scots borderers
used to call themselves <i>Scuytes</i> and
<i>Skytes</i>, as we learn from Camden. The
Saxon-Scots readily adopted this name, being
ignorant of its original import; but the
Highlanders have always deemed it a term
of reproach, and consequently retain their
original denomination, <i>Albanich</i>."&mdash;Abridged

In connexion with this, it is of importance
to note the observations of Major Rawlinson
in reference to the indications of the
aboriginal races of Asia afforded by the
Cuneatic inscriptions. He conceives that
the Sacæ or Cymri frequently mentioned on
the inscriptions at Khorsabad, and who
appear to have been generally introduced
into the Assyrian empire about the thirteenth
century before Christ, were probably
of Scythian origin. He, however, thinks it
impossible to identify this tribe immediately
with the Gaelic Cymri. It appears more
probable that, under the name of Cymri,
the Assyrians included all the Nomade
tribes with whom they were acquainted,
without respect to ethnological family; but
he suggests that the Celtæ subsequently applied
this generic name specifically to themselves,
as among the Moguls of the present
day a particular tribe have taken the name
of "Eluth" or "Ilyat," which properly denotes
a mere Nomadic population. The
other tribes with which the Assyrians were
chiefly brought in contact, were the Shetta
or Khyta in Syria, and the Ludi in Lower
Babylonia. The former tribe are well
known from the inscriptions of Egypt, and
the latter were probably the same people
who are mentioned in Ezekiel under the
name of "Lud," in connexion with "Phut"
and "Elam." These tribes of Khita and
Luda were both undoubtedly of Semitic origin.
</p>
<p>
We may confidently anticipate that these
researches into the races and languages of
the central region of Asia, from whence we
believe the human family to have been gradually
diffused over remoter countries, until
the first colonists reached our own western
island, will yet furnish much of the precise
information we require relative to the
earliest Asiatic migrations of the Celtæ, and
the degree of civilisation possessed by them
when they began the north-western movement
that finally led them to the remotest countries
of Europe, bordering on the Atlantic.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

SCULPTURED STANDING STONES.</h3>


<p>The progress of our inquiry into the peculiar characteristics of
Scottish Archæology brings under consideration one of the most interesting,
yet most puzzling classes of monuments of early native
art. While England has her Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical remains
exhibiting more or less distinct traces of the transition by which the
debased Roman passed into the pure Romanesque or Norman style,
Scotland, along with Ireland, possesses examples of an early native
style of ecclesiastical architecture and of Christian monuments, belonging
to the same undefined period prior to the Norman invasion of
England.</p>

<p>Of the Sculptured Standing Stones of Scotland, including these
primitive Christian monuments, a few of the best known examples
have been repeatedly engraved, but generally on so small a scale, and
with so little attention to accuracy of detail, that they have failed to
secure that interest among British archæologists which their great
number and the very beautiful and singular character of their sculptures
merit. The reproach of leaving these remarkable national
monuments unillustrated has, however, been to a great extent removed
by the publication of Mr. Patrick Chalmers' magnificent work on the
Ancient Monuments of the County of Angus,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> which furnishes an
extensive series of examples of the various sculptured stones long
ascribed to a Danish origin, but now nearly all recognised as peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>to Scotland. Attempts to decorate Scottish sepulchral memorials by
means of sculptured ornaments appear to have been made from an
early period. Several curious examples have already been noted of
stone cists, otherwise entirely unhewn, the covers of which have been
rudely ornamented with incised patterns similar to those which are
seen on the gigantic chambered cairn of New Grange, near Drogheda.
But greater interest perhaps attaches to another though more simply
decorated Scottish cist pertaining apparently to a much later period
than the cairn of New Grange, or the incised cists which have
been classed with that remarkable primitive sepulchre. On a rising
ground about half a mile to the east of the town of Alloa, called the
Hawkhill, is the large upright block of sandstone sculptured with a
cross which is represented in the annexed engraving. It measures
ten and a quarter feet in height, though little more than seven feet
are now visible above ground. A
similar cross is cut on both sides
of the stone, as is not uncommon
with such simple memorials.
During the progress of agricultural
operations in the immediate
vicinity of this ancient cross, in
the spring of 1829, Mr. Robert
Bald, C.E., an intelligent Scottish
antiquary, obtained permission
from the Earl of Mar to make
some excavations around it, when,
at about nine feet north from the
monumental stone, a rude cist
was found, constructed of unhewn
sandstone, measuring only three feet in length, and at each end of
the cover, <i>on the under side</i>, a simple cross was cut. The lines which
formed the crosses were not rudely executed, but straight and uniform,
and evidently finished with care, though the slab itself was unusually
rude and amorphous. The cist lay east and west, and contained nothing
but human bones greatly decayed. Drawings of the cross and
cist, and a plan of the ground, executed by Mr. Bald, are in the possession
of the Society of Antiquaries. Here we possess a singularly interesting
example of the union of Christian and Pagan sepulchral
rites: the cist laid east and west, according to the early Christian
custom, yet constructed of the old circumscribed dimensions, and of
the rude but durable materials in use for ages before the new faith
had superseded the aboriginal Pagan creeds.</p>

</div>

<p>To this same transition-period there can now be little hesitation in
assigning that remarkable class of Scottish sculptured stones, decorated
most frequently on the one side with the figure of the cross, and on
the other with a few mystic symbols of constant recurrence which
still remain an enigma to British Antiquaries, and to most others a
subject of perfect indifference or contempt; though had they been
discovered on the banks of the Tigris or the Nile they would have
been thought worthy of the united efforts of European scholars for
their solution. Some of these monuments most probably belong to
Pagan times, as they contain only the mysterious symbols, unaccompanied
by the emblem of the Christian faith, and are usually of ruder
execution, and cut on unhewn stones. Of this class are the Standing
Stones at Kinellar and Newton, Aberdeenshire;<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> and those of Aberlemno,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
and Kirktown of Dunnichen, in Angusshire.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Theorists who
have deemed it indispensable to assign
to these singular monuments
an antiquity long prior to the
Christian era have supposed that
the cross has been superadded to
the older Pagan sculptures. No
traces of any such hybrid union are
now discoverable, but, on the contrary,
where we find the Christian
and Pagan symbols combined, they
are almost invariably accompanied
with elaborately interlaced patterns
and figures of dragons, serpents, and
nondescript monsters, bearing a
close and unmistakable resemblance
to the decorations of some of the
most ancient Irish manuscripts,
nearly corresponding to the era of the introduction of Christianity
into Scotland. Several of the beautiful initials from the Book of
Kells, an Irish MS. of the sixth century, as engraved in Mr. Westwood's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>Palæographia, bear a close resemblance to the style of ornament
of these sculptures; while the interlaced knotwork on the case
of the shrine of St. Maidoc, which Dr. Petrie conceives cannot be later
than the eighth century, though less distinctly characteristic, and by
no means peculiar to Ireland, very nearly corresponds in its details to
the ornamentation frequently introduced on these Scottish monuments.
Others, such as the Aberlemno and one of the Meigle crosses, are decorated
with raised pellets or nail-heads, manifestly derived from the
ornamental studs of the old British buckler, also to be found elsewhere;
as on one of the Manx sanctuary crosses to be seen about a mile from
St. Maughold's Church, in the Isle of Man. The arrangements of the
figures in some of the Scottish monuments of this period, as in the
celebrated Forres column, are also strikingly suggestive of intimate
intercourse between Scotland and Ireland at the period of their erection,
from their correspondence to such works as the beautiful crosses
at Monasterboice. In this case, however, the Irish are evidently the
later works, and are, indeed, assigned by Dr. Petrie to the early part
of the tenth century.</p>

<p>The locality in which these remarkable monuments are found is
also worthy of notice. No example occurs within the ancient limits
of Dalriada, or on the western coast in the vicinity of Ireland, nor
has any one been discovered south of the Forth, though met with
both at Largo and St. Andrews, or north of the ancient southern
limits of the Norse kingdom, if we except one now erected in the
pleasure-grounds of Dunrobin Castle. Yet it is within the same
limited range of country, extending along our eastern coast, that the
only examples of primitive ecclesiastical architecture occur undoubtedly
pertaining to the Scottish Celtic Church prior to its remodelling
in the eleventh century.</p>

<p>No sculptured memorials of the singular class so abundant in
Scotland, have been discovered in Ireland, any more than in Norway,
Sweden, or Denmark, though so long ascribed to a Scandinavian
origin. They are manifestly native monuments, though betraying
the same traces of the influence of early Irish art, or at least indications
of a period when the peculiar style of their ornamentation was
common both to Scotland and Ireland, with which we are familiar in
the works of the closing Pagan era. Only one known period of Scottish
history answers to these requirements, and seems to point out
the ruder class of sculptured standing stones as the monuments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
the Pagan Picts, and the more elaborate ones, accompanied with the
symbol of the Christian faith, as belonging to that period which has
been slightly sketched in a preceding chapter, when Christianity was
introduced to the Scottish Picts at the very time in which we possess
numerous proofs of the most intimate intercourse between the two
countries. What we chiefly want at present for the elucidation of
Scottish Archæology is not theories but facts; yet such historical
coincidences, though doubtless open to challenge, are not unworthy
of note, and cannot justly be ranked along with the vague theoretical
speculations, destitute of any foundation but the fancy of their originators,
which have discovered in these Scottish sculptures Egyptian,
Ph&#339;nician, Braminical, or Druidical symbols, as it chanced to suit
the favourite theory of the hour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 243px;">
<img src="images/image499.jpg" width="243" height="589" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Dunnichen Stone affords a good example of the most frequent
symbolic figures: the <b>Z</b> shaped symbol, sometimes, as in this case,
intersecting two circles decorated within with foliated lines, and
united most frequently by two reversed
curves, or occasionally intertwined with a
serpent. Along with these, there is also
often introduced a crescent-shaped device&mdash;the
favourite emblem of Druidical theorists&mdash;intersected
by a <b>V</b> figure, more or
less floriated, as on St. Orland's Stone at
Cossins,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> the Aberlemno Cross,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> and many
others. Ingenious theorists have recognised
in these the initial Z, L, S, of Zodiacus, Sol,
and Luna, and the key to a whole system
of mystical enigmas! Another figure which
occurs on the Dunnichen Stone has been
discovered to be the <i>Atf</i>, or high cap of
the Egyptian Osiris surmounted by a
lotus! The same combination of symbols,
however, is engraved on one of the remarkable
silver relics found at Norrie's Law,
Fifeshire, as shewn here the same size as
the original. From this there can be no
doubt that it represents an animal's, probably
a dog's, head; and this is equally apparent on one of the crosses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>in the churchyard of Meigle, and also on what is called "King Malcolm's
grave-stone" at Glammis, where the same figure accompanies
the two-handed mirror. A writer in the Archæological Journal mentions
having met with an almost precisely similar ornament to one of
these symbols on Gnostic gems and coins bearing cabalistic inscriptions;
and "hence he is led to think that the carvings on the reverse
sides of these stones may have been intended to refer to the perpetual
conflict between the Cross on the one hand, and false doctrines and
worldly pursuits on the other. The Gnostic emblem being intended
as an indication of the former of these principles, counteracting and
opposing the spreading of the doctrines of the Cross, and the scenes
of the chase (so frequently accompanying these sculptured emblems)
as indicating the latter."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Such abstruse and recondite ideas, however,
seem altogether irreconcilable with the age to which the monuments
must be assigned, while they leave the main point still unsolved,
as to how these symbols do indicate false doctrines or a Pagan faith.
Two objects of domestic use, the mirror and comb, frequently accompany
the more mysterious figures, and after being assumed by earlier
antiquaries as the indications of a female monument, have more
recently been traced to the supposed emblems of Christian martyrdom
found sculptured on the tombs of the Roman catacombs. Dr.
Maitland, however, has successfully combated this mode of explaining
what were often no more than the implements of a trade or profession.
Above the figures of a mirror, comb, and pair of shears, on
one of the primitive Roman tombs, are the simple words <span class="smcap">VENERIÆ</span>
<span class="smcap">IN PACE</span>, <i>To Veneria in peace</i>,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>&mdash;indications apparently solely of the
sex, or possibly of the occupation of the deceased. That these symbols
were used in Scotland for the same purpose at a much later
period, is proved by the sculptures on some medieval tombs, and in
particular on that of the prioress Anna at Iona, who, though a religious,
looks no martyr on her tomb. It is engraved by Pennant,
(vol. ii. <i>Pl.</i> XXIV. fig. 2,) and more minutely, though in a greatly
more imperfect state, in Mr. H. D. Graham's admirable illustrations
of the Antiquities of Iona, (<i>Pl.</i> XLV.) Two angels arrange the
pillow of the good prioress, a lady neither of spare nor youthful
figure; while on either side of her are her little lap-dogs, each with
a riband and bell to its neck, and over all the mirror and comb:
possibly designed on this, as well as on the Roman lady's tomb, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>indicate the virginity or celibacy of the dead. Besides these figures
of most frequent occurrence, however, others are also occasionally
found curiously referrible to an eastern origin, and, in particular, a
symbolic elephant, as on Martin's Stone at Ballutheron, on one of the
crosses in the churchyard of Meigle,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> and on the Maiden Stone on
Bennochie, Aberdeenshire, where it accompanies the comb and mirror,
from which the monument has probably derived its name.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The peculiar
character of these singular representations of the elephant is well
worthy of study from the evidence they afford of the existence of
eastern traditions at the period of their execution. It is impossible
to mistake the object intended by the design, while at the same time
it is obvious that the artist can never have seen an elephant. What
should be the feet are curled up into scrolls, and the trunk is occasionally
thrown in a straight line over the back, whereas horses and
other animals with which he is familiar are executed with great spirit
and truth. Fabulous and monstrous figures also accompany these,
such as the centaur occasionally bearing the cross in its hands, and
what appears in some to be a branch of mistletoe, as on the reverse
of another of the singular crosses in the churchyard at Meigle. On a
stone near Glammis a man with a crocodile's head is introduced; on
one of the Meigle crosses, among sundry other nondescript animals,
is the capricornus or sea-goat; and on the inscribed cross of St.
Vigeans a grotesque hybrid, half-bird half-beast, stalks among the
fantastic animals and intertwining snakes which decorate its border.</p>

<p>A most lively fancy is apparent in many of these designs; but
others are possessed of a much higher value as illustrations of the
manners, customs, dresses, weapons, musical instruments, &amp;c., in use
at the period when these monuments were erected. Thus in the very
curious piece of sculpture figured in the annexed engraving, we have
a representation of the use of the bow and arrow, and of a car drawn
by two horses. It is now preserved at Meigle along with others, the
supposed relics of the tomb of the frail Guanora, Arthur's queen,
who, according to Hector Boece, was made captive by the Picts, after
the defeat and death of Modred on the banks of the Humber, and
passed the remainder of her life in captivity within the strong fortress
of Dunbarr&eacute; or Barry Hill. Thus strangely do we find the romantic
tales of the old troubadours, once familiar through medieval Europe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>located by popular tradition in the district of Strathmore. Mr.
Chalmers conceives that scarcely a doubt can be entertained of the
reference to the monument at Meigle ascribed to Queen Guanora, and
of which the engraving represents one of the most curious portions, in
the following note, under the year 1569, in the Extracta e Cronicis
Scotiæ:&mdash;"At Newtylde<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> thair is ane stane, callit be sum the Thane
Stane, iii eln of heicht, v quarteris braid, ane quarter thik and mair,
with ane cors at the heid of it, and ane goddes next that in ane

and dogges, halkis and serpentis: on the west side of it, ane cors
curiouslie grauit; bot all is maid of ane auld fassane of schap. It is
allegit that the Thane of Glammis set thir tua stanis quhen that
cuntrey wes all ane greit forrest." This description is of great value,
not only as preserving a tradition associated with the stone at a
period very near the time of Boece, yet differing entirely from his
romantic tale of Queen Guanora, but much more so, in that it conveys
a tolerably definite idea of what the monument actually was in
the sixteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>The traditions associated with these singular monuments, whether
gathered directly from vague local traditions, or culled from the marvellous
pages of the monkish chroniclers, are equally contradictory
and valueless, as throwing any light on their origin, whether associated
with King Arthur and his ravished Queen, or, like the remarkable
Forres obelisk, popularly called King Sueno's Stone, believed to commemorate
the final defeat and ejection of the Norsemen from the
Scottish mainland. This beautiful monument, which measures twenty
three feet in height, has been repeatedly engraved;&mdash;by Gordon, on a
sufficiently large scale, but with little attempt at accuracy of detail,
and more carefully by Cordiner in his Scottish Antiquities.</p>

</div>

<p>There can be no question that many of those sculptured monuments
are designed to commemorate particular events, though they have
long since proved faithless to their trust. Most of such, however,
would probably be of less interest to us than the minute and varied
information which we are still able to deduce from the primitive
historic memorials. We see in them the warrior on horseback and on
foot, armed with sword, spear, battle-axe, and dirk, and bearing his
circular buckler on his arm,&mdash;a much larger shield than that previously
described among the later relics of the Pagan era, and, indeed,
closely resembling the Highland target, which continued in use in
Scotland till the final extinction of the patriarchal system and hereditary
customs of the Highland clans, after their last struggle on
Culloden Moor. Nor are the sculptures less minute in their illustrations
of domestic habits and social arts. In Plates II. and VI. of
Mr. Chalmers' valuable work, we have representations of ancient chairs,
and figures apparently of priests and monks. In the former, also, and
in Plate XIII., are a harp and harper, the latter executed with much
spirit, though now greatly defaced; while hunting and hawking scenes
frequently occur, accompanied with very graphic representations of
the beasts of chase. There is, moreover, a peculiar style running
throughout the whole of these sculptures, and a certain action and
contour in the figures and animals, which mark them with as distinctive
a character as belongs to any medieval or modern school of art.
The engraving on Plate IV. represents one of the most elaborate of
these Pictish hunting scenes, fully answering to the description of the
old Scottish chronicler, of "horsemen, fuitmen, and dogges, halkis
and serpentis." It occurs on what is believed to have formed part of
a stone coffin, which was dug up in the immediate vicinity of St.
Andrew's cathedral, and is now preserved in St. Mary's College there.
Along with this slab, which measures five and three-fourths feet long,
by two and one-fourth feet broad, there was found what appears to
have formed one end, and part of the other, of the same sarcophagus
or monument. Both are covered with intricate knotwork, and in
the more perfect of the two there are four compartments, two of which
are occupied each with a pair of apes, and the others with globes,
each encircled with two serpents. Not the least curious feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
this elaborate design is the introduction of well executed apes and
other animals, which we would have supposed entirely unknown to
the ancient sculptor. Besides these the ram, the horse and hawk, the
fawn, the greyhound pursuing the fox in the thicket, and the tiger
or leopard, as the fierce assailant of the horseman seems to be, are all
executed with great fidelity and spirit. In addition to these there is
a nondescript monster, a sort of winged griffin, preying upon a prostrate
ass. But by far the most valuable portions of this curious design
are the human figures, with their variety of character and costume.
Here manifestly is the Patrician, with his long locks and
flowing robes, and his richly decorated dirk at his side, while the
plebeian huntsman betrays his humble rank, not only in his homely
dress and accoutrements, but even in the lean and half-bred cur which
forms his companion in the chase. But the engraving will furnish a
much more satisfactory idea of these curious details than any description
could convey. The most common decoration of this remarkable
class of native Scottish monuments, apart from the symbols and sculptured
figures so frequently introduced, is the interlaced knotwork
which appears to have been so favourite a device of Celtic art. It
occurs on the sculptures, the jewelry, the manuscripts, and the decorated
shrines and book-cases of early Irish Christian art, and has
been perpetuated almost to our own day on the weapons and personal
ornaments of the Scottish Highlanders. The annexed illustration
represents a very characteristic
example of
the common Highland
brooch, from the original
in the collection of C. K.
Sharp, Esq. It is of
brass, rudely engraved,
evidently with the imperfect
tools of the native
mountaineer. The
tongue is of copper, and
the brooch measures four
and one-tenth inches in
diameter. Amid its decorations
will be recognised
the triple knot, the supposed emblem of the Trinity, along with
other interlaced patterns, such as occur in the bosses of sepulchral
and monumental crosses of the seventh and eighth centuries. Precisely
the same ornaments may be seen on the Highland targets, preserved
among the memorials of the field of Culloden; while other combinations
of this favourite pattern formed the universal decoration on
the handle of the Highland dirk, from the earliest known examples
to those belonging to the same fatal field, on which the unbroken
Celtic traditions of Scotland were involved in the fortunes of the fated
Stuart race.</p>

<p>Only two of the ancient sculptured standing stones peculiar to
Scotland are accompanied with inscriptions. One of them, discovered
about thirty years since, on demolishing the ancient Church
of Fordoun, in the Mearns, was then apparently undecipherable,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> and
has since become illegible; the other is on a beautiful though mutilated
cross in the churchyard of St. Vigeans. That of St. Vigeans
is in the common Celtic character familiar to us on early Irish monuments,
and on the oldest tombs at Iona, and therefore in so far adds
confirmation to the idea advanced as to the probable era of these
sculptures. But it is imperfect and perhaps too mutilated to admit
of intelligible translation, though sufficient remains in the first words,
A&#xA785;oil en, to shew that it is of the usual character of Scottish and
Irish Celtic monumental inscriptions.</p>

<p>"Mr. Petrie," says Mr. Chalmers, "is of opinion, from a portion of
it which he has deciphered, that the monument is Pictish, and he expresses
a hope that he will be able to explain the inscription." But
as the legible fragment seems to consist of only three words and
part of a fourth, no very valuable information can be looked for from
its fractional remainder.</p>

<p>One other peculiar and indeed altogether unique inscription occurs
on a rude unhewn standing stone of granite in the vicinity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
Maiden Stone, with its mysterious symbols, at Newton, in Garioch,
Aberdeenshire. The column measures fully six feet in height, and
about two feet in greatest breadth. On its upper part is the inscription,
extending to six lines, in large and sufficiently distinct, but entirely
novel and unintelligible characters. It has been more than
once engraved, and repeatedly submitted to eminent antiquaries, but
still remains undeciphered. General
Vallancey, the well-known Irish antiquary,
professed to read the two first
words of it. What indeed would he not
have undertaken to decipher? These
he rendered <i>Gylf Gomarra</i>, Prince
Gomarra, apparently from some slight
or fancied resemblance of the characters
to the corresponding Roman letters,
but his G and F are manifestly the
same, and the whole still remains an
enigma. The side of the same stone,
however, bears another inscription,
also shewn in part in the annexed engraving,
which appears to have escaped
the notice of earlier observers, though introduced as a mere ornament
in the representation inserted in the Transactions of the Scottish
Society of Antiquaries. It has recently been pronounced by Irish
antiquaries an Ogham inscription, and as such, is an object of considerable
interest, no other example of the use of that simple and extremely
primitive character, which the older antiquaries of Ireland
have made the subject of so many extravagant theories, having been
discovered in Scotland. It does not necessarily follow that the two
inscriptions belong to the same period, though found on one stone;
but both are as yet equally dumb and irresponsive oracles.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/image506.jpg" width="362" height="543" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Various early inscriptions in the same old Celtic character as that
engraved on the St. Vigeans' Cross are still to be found in Scotland,
and particularly in the Western Isles, where it had doubtless been in
general use, prior to the adoption of the later Church letters common
to medieval Europe. Of this class are two stones at Iona, adorned
with simple crosses, one of which has been made the subject of some
very fruitless speculation. "No one of the inscriptions in Iona," says
Mr. H. D. Graham, "has been so much written about as this, and anti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>quarians
do not agree as to its signification. It is in the old Gaelic
character, and has been usually interpreted into <i>Donull fada Chasach</i>&mdash;The
cross of Donald Longshanks."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> An older decipherer reads it,
"<i>Cormac Ulphada hic est situs</i>," indicative of the sepulchre of Cormac
Barbatus, one of the kings of Ireland, buried there <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 213; and a
third assigns it as the memorial of a king of France, who according to
equally credible tradition found his last resting-place in the sacred
isle. Mr. Graham has accordingly designated it in his Illustrations of
the Monuments of Iona, "the disputed inscription," though finding
for it a new reading, which assigns it to a Macdonald of the Glengary
line, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1461. The inscription reads: O&#xA783;&#x0304; &#xA77A;o mail &#xA77B;a&#xA787;a&#xA783;ic, or
with the first word extended:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">ORO&#x0196;&#xA786; &#xA779;O M&#x2C6D;&#x0196;&#x026D; &#xA77B;&#x2C6D;&#xA786;&#x2C6D;R&#x0196;C</span><br />
<i>A Prayer for the servant of Patrick.</i>
</p>

<p>Its modest memorial is sufficiently indefinite, yet it may be assumed
with much probability to mark the tomb of Bishop Patrick, whose
demise is thus recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, under
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1174: "Maol Patrick O'Banan, Bishop of Conor and Dal Araidhe,
a venerable man, full of sanctity, meekness, and purity of heart, died
happily in Hy of Columkille, at a good old age."<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>Another rude and unsquared slab, with a slightly ornamented
cross, bears the still simpler inscription: O&#42883;&#772; &#593;&#42883; &#593;&#42883;m&#617;n &#1013;o&#7545;&#593;&#617;n,
<i>armin</i>, or more commonly <i>armunn</i>, being a brave man or chief. Extended
it reads:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">ORO&#406;&#42886; &#11373;R &#11373;RM&#406;N &#1013;O&#42877;&#11373;&#406;N</span><br />
<i>A Prayer for the Chief Eogain or Ewen.</i>
</p>

<p>Eogan or Eoganan, of the Albanic Duan, commenced his reign over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>the Dalriads in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 801, and subsequently wrested from the Southern
Picts the territories conquered by Angus MacFergus, and governed
for a time by princes of his line.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> The name is not uncommon among
the early western chiefs; and the Lord of Argyle at the period of Haco's
invasion in 1263, as appears from various early charters, was Eugene
or Ewen, son of Duncan, a descendant of the great Somerled.</p>

<p>Various other stones, with crosses cut upon them, evidently of the
same date as those thus inscribed, lie scattered among the remarkable
tombs of the <span class="smcap">Relig Oran</span>, or St. Oran's Burial Ground,&mdash;that sacred
spot, the resting-place of saints, and kings, and old island chiefs, so
deeply interesting to every Scottish heart,&mdash;but these are the only
examples of this early class on which inscriptions are now decipherable.
Many of the tombs of a later date are ornamented with figures
and floriated patterns in relief, characterized by singular beauty and
great variety of design. The style of ornamentation on some of them
is peculiar to the Western Isles and the neighbouring Scottish mainland:
but such ample justice has been done to them in the recent
beautiful series of views of the "Antiquities of Iona," by Mr. H. D.
Graham, that it is unnecessary to resort to the less intelligible process
of verbal description. The intermingling of foliage, scroll-work, chain-work,
geometric patterns, and knotwork, with animals, figures, and
sacred or warlike implements, is characterized by a profuseness and
variety of design such as the sepulchral monuments of scarcely any
other single locality or age can equal. The greater number of them,
however, belong to a later period than that now under consideration,
but on this very account, as well as for other reasons, we must dissent
from the conclusions as to the origin of their style of art, advanced
by the Rev. J. S. Howison, in his valuable papers on the Antiquities
of Argyleshire. The well-ascertained dates of some of the most remarkable
of these monuments fix their era from the fourteenth to the
sixteenth century. The accompanying illustration supplies a characteristic
example, in the mutilated cross of Lauchlan M'Fingon, the father
of Abbot John of Iona, who died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1500, and had a more important
tomb, adorned with his recumbent figure in full canonicals, within
the cathedral, though his name figures on the cross in St. Oran's
Chapel, erected as we may presume by himself. It is a valuable
illustration for our present purpose, as the inscription and date are
still perfectly legible: &#10016; Hec: est: Crux: Laeclanni: Maic: Fingone:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
et: eius: filii: Johannis: abbatis: de: Hy: facta anno: domini: <span class="smcap">M<sup>o</sup></span>:
<span class="smcap">CCCC</span><sup>o</sup>: <span class="smcap">LXXX<sup>o</sup></span> <span class="smcap">IX<sup>o</sup>.</span> The <i>lymphad</i>, which figures as one of the herald's
quarterings of the Mackinnons, is indeed
believed to have been derived
from the Northmen, but in the form it
assumes on this and other Iona sculptures,
it bears as little resemblance to
the long-oared war galley so frequently
engraved on native Scandinavian monuments
and relics as the accompanying
ornaments do to any known device
of Northern origin. The late era to
which some of the most characteristic
of these sculptures belong, should
alone suffice to disprove the idea "that
the Scandinavians were the authors of
this particular kind of art exhibited
by the stone crosses, as also by the sepulchral
monuments of Argyleshire;"<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
but no such monuments are now to be
found in any of the Scandinavian kingdoms,
and since the style must have
arisen somewhere, it is surely not more
difficult to conceive of it originating in
Scotland than in Norway, Sweden, or
Denmark. In so far as it is derived, its
suggestive originals appear to have been
much more Irish than Scandinavian. Its
peculiar individuality, however, arises
from the same cause as the very singular
characteristics of Irish ecclesiology.
Both Scotland and Ireland stood more
apart than any other of the kingdoms
of Christendom from the Crusades and
other great movements which conferred
so remarkable a homogeneity on
medieval Europe. The earlier arts
were consequently left there to develop new forms and modifications
long after they had been elsewhere entirely superseded by the later
styles of medieval art. At the period to which the beautiful monuments
of Argyleshire are referrible that district stood singularly isolated,
sharing only very partially even in the influences of Scottish art, and
still less in its social progress, while at the same time the peculiar
sanctity indissolubly associated with its ancient shrines kept alive
the spirit in which these originated. Scarcely any circumstances can
be conceived more favourable for the development of a new style of
art; and hence not only the peculiarity but the endless variety discoverable
on the monuments of Argyleshire, and especially in the
Relig Oran of Iona. A Scotsman may be pardoned even for some
excess of zeal in advancing his claims for sole hereditary right to
that historic ground, and the moss-grown sculptures with which it is
paved, where</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

THE NORRIE'S LAW RELICS.</h3>


<p>The most remarkable discovery of ancient personal ornaments and
other relics of a remote period ever made in Scotland, was that of
"<span class="smcap">The Silver Armour of Norrie's Law</span>," a tumulus or artificial
mound which stands on the marches of the two estates of Teasses
and Largo, in Fifeshire. The correspondence of the engraved devices
on this collection of silver relics with the mysterious symbols
which constantly recur on the sculptured standing stones of Scotland,
has served, along with the singular character and great beauty of
some of the ornaments, to confer on this discovery an interest attached
to no other Scottish hoard. This feeling has not been lessened
by the fact that only a very few of these precious relics have been
preserved; while the imperfect, vague, and probably exaggerated descriptions,
of such as were destroyed, have not lessened the feelings of
disappointed curiosity and regret with which archæologists refer to
the discovery.</p>

<p>The Bay of Largo, on the northern shores of the Frith of Forth, is
a large and well-sheltered indentation, furnishing the most accessible
position for a safe anchorage and haven near the mouth of the Frith.
In the sandy slope near the shore, at the head of the bay, the beautiful
gold armillæ were found, in 1848, which have been already
figured and described among the relics of a remoter period than that
of which we now treat.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> The remarkable tumulus which furnished
the silver ornaments now referred to is situated on the estate of Largo,
about three miles from the bay, and is affirmed to have been reputed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>in old local traditions, to cover the chief of a great army, deposited
there with his steed, and armed in panoply of massive silver. Instances
of the like popular belief have occasionally received such remarkable
confirmation that they cannot be pronounced by the archæologist as
altogether valueless.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> In this case, however, it may admit of doubt
if the origin of the tradition be not subsequent to the discovery.
The Old Statistical Account refers to the tradition, that the Stones
of Lundin "are the grave-stones of some Danish chiefs who fell in
battle with the Scots near the place;"<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> but the only allusion made
to Norrie's Law is to be gathered from an addition to the description
of Largo Law, a well-known hill which rises about eight hundred feet
above the level of the sea, and formed of old one of the most prominent
beacon-hills of Fife. "Besides this," the Statist remarks, "there
are two other Laws. But it is evident that these have been artificial.
When the cairn was removed from one of them a few years ago a
stone coffin was found at the bottom. From the position of the bones
it appeared that the person had been buried in a singular manner:
the legs and arms had been carefully severed from the trunk and laid
diagonally across it."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>The precise facts connected with the opening of the tumulus of
Norrie's Law, and even the year in which it occurred, are very
uncertain, though the person by whom the valuable hoard was purloined
still resides, in good circumstances, at Pitlessie in Fife. Conscious
as he is of the appropriation of treasure which was not his own,
and not yet entirely free from apprehension of the interference of the
Scottish Exchequer to reclaim the fruits of his ill-gotten wealth, he
naturally declines all communication on the subject, and thus, as too
frequently results from the operation of the present Scottish law of
treasure-trove, the history of the discovery is involved in impenetrable
mystery. It may be permitted us to reflect with some satisfaction,
that by the fears thus excited the depredator has not entirely escaped
punishment for the irreparable mischief which his wretched cupidity
has occasioned.</p>

<p>So far as can now be ascertained, in or about the year 1817 an
opening was made in the tumulus of Norrie's Law by a hawker or
pedlar who frequented the district, and it is possible may have had
his attention attracted to the mound by the popular tradition already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>referred to, which, if it then existed, could scarcely escape him in his
annual rounds of the parish. A stone cist was exposed within the
tumulus, containing, it is said, no bones or other indications of human
remains; but either in or near it were found the silver relics,
which the discoverer removed piecemeal, and sold, as opportunity
offered, to various silversmiths to be melted down and destroyed. In
1839, upwards of twenty years after this remarkable discovery, the
attention of Mr. George Buist of Cupar was directed to the subject,
in consequence of discovering that among a few fragments of the
original hoard which had been rescued by General Durham, the proprietor
of the estate, there were several relics marked with the same
peculiar symbols which form so singular a characteristic of the sculptured
standing stones of Scotland. Mr. Buist was then engaged in
investigating this remarkable class of antiquities, and to the report
which he published we are chiefly indebted for the knowledge we
now possess regarding "The Silver Armour of Norrie's Law." Mr.
Buist, with much industry and perseverance, gathered such information
as was then recoverable from persons cognizant of the discovery,
and in particular obtained from the country silversmith, who
had been one of the chief purchasers of the stolen treasure, the following
notes of various sales, by which we obtain a very satisfactory means
of estimating the great extent and value of the original deposit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For the information in regard to the lost portion of the Norrie's Law armour
I have been indebted to Mr. R. Robertson, jeweller, Cupar, or to individuals to
whom I have been by him referred. Mr. Robertson first made a purchase of &pound;5,
subsequently two of &pound;10, and knew of another made by some one about Edinburgh
to the amount of about &pound;20, and is under the belief that perhaps as much
as that here accounted for may have been carried away, and bestowed on various
uses. This, by rough computation, may, together with what remains, be reckoned
not much under 400 ounces of pure bullion. Mr. Robertson has, as may be readily
supposed, a peculiarly distinct recollection of the forms of the various portions of
the armour procured by him, and gives a most vivid description in particular of the
rich carving of the shield, the helmet, and the sword-handle, which were brought
to him crushed in pieces, to permit convenient transport and concealment....
A considerable part of the armour was partially corroded, the alloy
having been eaten away as if by some weak acid, exactly after the manner of
that employed in certain operations of modern silversmiths. The bullion in this
case was much more pure than in those cases where it remained solid and untouched.
It was, in fact, reduced to the state of porous, brittle, spongy silver.
The parts chiefly affected in this way were those lowest down, which seem to have
suffered from long exposure to some subtle corrosive. The upper portions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
fresh, compact, and entire. In them the silver was nearly the same as our present
standard."<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p></div>

<p>The report from which the above is extracted is illustrated with
lithographic drawings of the relics in the possession of General Durham,
and also with representations of the shield and sword-hilt, drawn
apparently from the recollections of the silversmith. But even when
brought to him, crushed and broken, it must have been difficult to form
a just opinion of their original appearance; and after the lapse of upwards
of twenty years, any attempt to recover their precise form or
details from memory must be utterly worthless. Judging indeed from
the fragments which remain, it may even admit of doubt if these
silver relics ever included any armour or weapons of war. In 1849,
Mrs. Durham of Largo House entrusted the silver ornaments rescued
by General Durham, to the care of Mr. Albert Way for exhibition at a
meeting of the Archæological Institute; and through the liberality
of the Council I am now enabled to avail myself of the engravings then
made from them. Profound as the regret must ever be with which
we refer to this discovery, it is yet no slight matter of congratulation
that even these few memorials of so remarkable a sepulchral deposit
remain to furnish some evidence of its character, and the period to
which it belongs. They were mostly picked up by the brother-in-law
of the tenant, and another person, both now deceased; having, it may
be presumed, been dropped by their original discoverer in his secret
and guilty haste. The inquiry instituted by Mr. Buist led to the recovery
of one of the bodkins, and also of one of the engraved scale plates
mentioned in the following description. It is perhaps hardly now to
be hoped for that any further additions will be made to the rescued
waifs of this ravished treasure.</p>

<p>The most interesting of the whole relics are the two leaf-shaped
plates of silver, engraved with the mystic symbol of such frequent
occurrence on Scottish sculptured Standing Stones. One of the monuments
of this class, though destitute of the peculiar symbols
here referred to, was found in fragments on the Largo estate, and
through the good taste of the late General Durham, has been again
reunited, and erected upon a pedestal near the spot where it was discovered.
On one side it bears as usual the figure of a cross, and on
the other, horsemen, dogs, and other animals, most prominent among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
which is the symbolic elephant frequently found on the same singular
class of memorials. Though destitute of the peculiar devices which
confer so great an interest on the silver relics found in its vicinity,
this monument is of great value as furnishing independent evidence
of the prevalence of the same arts in this locality at the dawn of
the Scottish Christian Period. The two leaf-shaped plates, one of
which has already been figured,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> are almost precisely similar. On
one the marginal line is wanting which appears in the representation
given in the last chapter, but some indications seem to shew that it
has been burnished out. The devices on both are deeply engraved,
and it is possible may have been enamelled. Mr. Buist describes in
his report small lozenge-shaped plates of silver, which formed part of
a rich coat of scale armour; referring, there can be little doubt, to
these leaf-shaped plates, both of which he has figured. The one
already engraved is the size of the original, which weighs 598 grains;
the other corresponds in size, but is somewhat above eighty grains
lighter in weight. But there is no indication of any means of attachment
so as to unite them in a suit of armour, or suspend them to the
dress of the wearer. The spirally decorated bosses at the broader
ends are concave on the under side, and present no appearance of
having ever had anything attached to them. The original destination
of these singular relics is indeed involved in the same mystery
as the peculiar symbols with which they are engraved.</p>

<p>Next in interest to these scale plates of silver are a pair of bodkins,
measuring in length rather more than six and a half inches, and engraved
here the size of the originals. They are both alike, with the exception
that on the reverse side of one is an imperfect indication of the
<b>Z</b> symbol, the figure of which is interrupted by the attachment of the
pin. The form of the head is peculiar, though not unique, pins of
nearly similar fashion having been found in Ireland. A brass bodkin
of this type, in the Museum of Trinity College, Dublin, is almost precisely
the same in form and dimensions, and only differs in the ornament
introduced in the front of the head.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Another example of the
same type, found at Lagore, County Meath, is figured in the Archæological
Journal.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> It is made of bronze, and is inferior in point of
workmanship, but is equally valuable from the undoubted evidence it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>affords of the native origin of this peculiar form of pin, and of the other
relics discovered along with it. The front of the head in the Largo
bodkin is beautifully chased in
the same style of ornaments as the
scale plates, and the central projecting
stud bears a Greek cross
pat&eacute;e, thus presented, as on the
Scottish sculptured stones, in connexion
with these mysterious symbols.
The mode of introducing
the symbol on the bodkin is peculiarly
suggestive of its use as a
charm. It is engraved where it
was evidently not intended to be
seen, and where indeed its form is
by no means adapted as a decoration
to the peculiar shape of the
work on which it is introduced.
The spiral ornaments on the opposite
side are, on the contrary, arranged
for effect; and though corresponding
to those on the double
circles of the scale plate, are suggestive
only of decorative design,
the same peculiar form being
greatly varied in pattern, and even
frequently left blank on the sculptured
stones. Another smaller pin
of the same class is in the Durham
collection. It appears to have
been jewelled, but is very imperfect.
It measures one and a quarter
inch in length.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Silver Bodkins, Largo</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two ornaments, described by
Mr. Buist as "circles or armlets,"
appear to be the large ring fibulæ
of a type common both as Irish
and early Highland brooches. The
most perfect of the two, which measures five and three-quarter inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
in diameter, is represented here half the size of the original. The
acus or tongue is wanting in both of them. The torquated hoop is
a rare feature in such ornaments, and indeed much seldomer found
in works of silver than of gold. It forms the simplest style of ornamentation,
and, though by no means inelegant, corresponds very imperfectly
with the fully developed style of art indicated in the other
contents of the Largo tumulus, with perhaps the exception of a silver
disc, figured in the Archæological Journal, half the size of the original.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
This measures three inches in diameter, and has a central boss
with a circular depression, which may not improbably have been set
with a jewel of amber or stone. The torquated hoop of the silver
fibula does not appear the best adapted for the free movement of the
<i>acus</i>, but this seems rarely to have been much attended to. Where,
as in these examples, the hoop is disunited, the <i>acus</i> is generally of
great length, not infrequently measuring two, and even two and a
half times the diameter of its circle. Nothing more was required for
fastening such a fibula after the tongue had been passed through the
dress, than to turn it slightly past the opening, for which purpose its
perforation is always sufficiently wide. The revived taste for archæological
pursuits has once more restored this ancient form adapted to
the fashions of modern dress, and one of the most favourite Scottish
patterns bears the name of the Maid of Norway's Brooch.</p>

</div>

<p>It is less easy to assign a use for another of the Norrie's Law
relics, engraved here half the size of the original. Mr. Albert Way
describes it as "a plate of silver, enriched with singular scrolls or
foliated ornaments in very
high relief. Three of these
remain; there was obviously
a fourth, connected with
the corresponding scroll by
a narrow neck, the plate
being formed with an irregular
oblong opening in the
centre. Dimensions of the
plate, four and a half inches
by four inches; length of
the opening, two and a half
inches; projection of the
ornaments more than a
quarter of an inch. They appear to have been cast, and are formed
with great elegance of outline and skilful workmanship." It is obvious
that the plate when complete had not been uniform. It would
now be vain to speculate on its original purpose, though this appears
to be the object described in Mr. Buist's report as the mouthpiece of
a sword-scabbard; his whole ideas having obviously been modified by
the local belief in the "suit of silver armour" in which the mounted
warrior was interred. There is manifestly but little correspondence
in it either to a modern sword-guard or the mouthpiece of its scabbard,
and it bears not the slightest resemblance to any known
appendage of ancient weapons.</p>

<p>The remaining relics of this hoard include two fragments of armillæ,
formed of plain silver plates, beaten out so as to present a convex
outer face; a double hook, one inch in length, in form of an S; a
narrow band, like a riband of silver, about half an inch in width,
and upwards of a yard long: one end, which appears perfect, tapering
to a point; a fragment of fine interlaced silver; and a spiral
silver ring, almost precisely similar in form to one of bronze found in
a cist near Edinburgh, and figured in a former chapter.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> It weighs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>120 grains, and is ornamented only with a minute serrated pattern
wrought along part of the inner edge of the spiral bar of silver towards
either extremity.</p>

<p>Such are the few but valuable relics which have escaped the
crucible, amounting altogether only to about twenty-four ounces out
of the estimated 400 ounces of pure silver found in the Norrie's Law
tumulus by its unprincipled ravisher. That they exhibit the high
progress attained by native artists at the period to which they belong
can hardly admit of a doubt. The analogy which the forms both of
the fibulæ and bodkins suggest&mdash;so clearly traceable to types of most
frequent occurrence in Ireland&mdash;fully corresponds to the historic
origin of the races and the arts of Scotland, already traced out in the
previous chapter. Their peculiar devices, found only on the earliest
Christian monuments of Scotland, no less distinctly refer these remarkable
relics to that native transition-period from the fourth to
the eighth century, when Pagan and Christian rites were obscurely
mingled; and the revelations of the old sepulchral mound shew that
the anticipations of the dying warrior still derived their most vivid
power more from the heathen valhalla than the Christian paradise.
We shall not perhaps greatly err in limiting the era of the Norrie's
Law tumulus from the third to the sixth century. We must even
allow for the lapse of a sufficient interval between the last surviving
witness of the deposition of its treasures, and the advent of that new
creed and system which finally abolished the sacredness that formed
the old safeguard of the Pagan treasures of the dead. But in addition
to every other cause of regret for the barbarous destruction of
these beautiful examples of the arts as practised in Scotland a thousand
years ago, we have reason to believe that an opportunity was
lost&mdash;perhaps the only one that can ever occur&mdash;of ascertaining the
precise epoch, and even the meaning of the remarkable Scottish
symbols with which they were decorated. Mr. Buist remarks in his
report,&mdash;"A considerable number of coins, now wholly lost sight of,
and said to have borne these symbolic markings, were found along
with the armour at Norrie's Law, and about forty of the same kind
were found in an earthen pot at Pittenweem in 1822. It is said that
these were destitute of inscription or written character." No great
importance can be attached to such vague descriptions of coins chiefly
derived from the recollections of persons probably little familiar with
any but those of the present currency. But of the fact of coins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
having been found no doubt can be entertained. Nor is this the only
instance of such being met with in a Scottish tumulus, though hitherto
they have only been discovered to be destroyed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/image520.jpg" width="471" height="210" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The most primitive form of Scottish coinage is evidently the simple
gold pellets usually marked with a cross
in relief. The two examples engraved
here, the size of the originals, are from
the remarkable hoard discovered at
Cairnmuir, Peeblesshire, in 1806.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> They
resemble two segments of a sphere irregularly
joined, and appear to have been cast in a mould. Forty of
the same simple class of early currency were found, along with what
appears to have been a gold funicular torc, in the parish of Dolphinton,
Lanarkshire, and marked, like those of Cairnmuir, "with the impression
of a star."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Little hesitation can be felt in assigning to the
same class a discovery, in the parish of Dunnichen, Forfarshire, of "a
number of small gold bullets, which seem to have been the current
coin of the times when they were formed."<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> A correspondent describes
to me a quantity of silver coins found about two years since
in a cist exposed on the demolition of a cairn on the lands of Sauchie,
Stirlingshire: "They were so thin that they readily broke in the
workmen's fingers; they seemed struck through from the back, and
had figures only on the one side; some of them had loops to hang
them by." The whole of these are now dispersed or lost, their ignorant
discoverers having seemingly contented themselves with the interesting
experiment of trying how readily they could break them in
pieces. There can be little doubt from the description that they were
silver bracteates; and if so, their loss is greatly to be regretted. A
cairn of peculiar construction is described in the Statistical Account
of the parish of Garvoch, Kincardineshire, within which was found a
silver brooch of ancient workmanship, and towards the margin upwards
of twenty coins, but these would appear to have been a later
deposit, as they included one of Alexander I., and another of Robert
Bruce.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The valuable numismatic collection of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland includes a few gold coins of the Gaulish type,
believed to have been found in Scotland, but their history or exact
locality is unknown. Mr. Lindsay, in his "View of the Coinage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>Scotland," justly remarks on the neglect of the investigation of this
interesting subject, which, until the publication of his work, had been
carried no farther back than the reign of William the Lion. To this
he has added the history of upwards of a century, and made us familiar
with some interesting early types. The earliest of these are of
the Crux type of Ethelred II., of whose coins they are evidently an
imitation, and are ascribed to the Norwegian jarls of the Hebrides.
In the autumn of 1782, some men engaged in clearing away the
foundation of an old wall in the island of Tyrie, one of the Hebrides,
found an urn containing from fifteen to twenty ounces of Anglo-Saxon
silver coins in fine preservation, ninety of these are now in the Scottish
Society's collection, and include silver pennies of Athelstan,
Eadmund, Eadred, Eadwy, Eadgar, and Eadweard the Martyr. In
the present year, 1850, a large hoard of Anglo-Saxon coins was discovered
in the Isle of Skye: upwards of ninety fell into the hands
of one individual, and a much greater number were dispersed. By
far the greater number are stykas of Eadgar. Barry mentions two
horns found at Caldale near Kirkwall, in the Orkneys, containing three
hundred coins of Canute, including forty-two varieties of mints, with
silver fibulæ and other relics, already described along with a more
recent discovery of a similar kind.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> To these also should be added the
occasional discovery of Cufic coins, inscribed in the old Arabic character,
and ranging from the latter end of the seventh to the close of
the tenth century. One of these, a fine gold coin, was discovered in
1823, at a considerable depth, in digging a grave in the churchyard
of Monymusk, Aberdeenshire.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> In all the discoveries referred to it is
of special importance to our present inquiries to note that coins and
other undoubted evidences of a comparatively recent date are rarely,
if ever, found with gold relics of Archaic types. We rather see distinct
reason to conclude that the stores of native gold and the direct
sources of foreign supply were both nearly exhausted at an earlier
period, and that silver, which chiefly belongs to the Iron or last Pagan
period, was the metal used for purposes of personal adornment and
display at the period when the peculiar native arts were developed
which appear to belong to the dawn of the Scottish Christian Period.
Whether derived from native or foreign sources, silver appears to have
been then in greater abundance, and more lavishly employed for mere
purposes of show than at any other period of our national history.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

SCOTO-SCANDINAVIAN RELICS.</h3>


<p>From the slight historical sketch introduced in a preceding chapter,
we perceive that the plundering expeditions of the Norse Vikings,
and the establishment of Norwegian dominion by Harold in the
Northern and Western Isles, were rapidly superseded by the establishment
of an independent Scoto-Norwegian kingdom, which diminished
the direct intercourse with Scandinavia Proper, and led to
some interfusion of the Celtic and Scandinavian races. To this
period, therefore, we must look for the introduction of pure Scandinavian
antiquities into Scotland, and also for the production of those
native relics which bear manifest traces of the influence of Scandinavian
art. In the Western Isles especially, where the expatriated
Vikings of Norway fixed their head-quarters, and in Man, and the
Orkney and Shetland Isles, where the first independent Scoto-Norwegian
kingdoms were established, we may naturally look for many
traces of Scandinavian arts.</p>

<p>To this period belongs the very characteristic and beautiful ornament,
usually designated the shell-shaped brooch, and which is
equally familiar to Scandinavian and British antiquaries. In Scotland
especially, many beautiful examples have been found: several
of them are preserved in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
and from these the following is selected as surpassing in beauty of
design and intricacy of ornament, any other example of which I am
aware. It consists, as usual, of a convex plate of metal, with an
ornamental border, surmounted by another convex plate of greater
depth, highly ornamented with embossed and perforated designs, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
effect of which appears to have been further heightened by the lower
plate being gilded so as to shew through the open work. In this
example the gilding still remains tolerably perfect. On the under
side are the projecting
plates still retaining a
fragment of the corroded
iron pin, where
it has turned on a
hinge, and at the opposite
end the bronze
catch into which it
clasped. The under
side of the brooch appears
to have been
lined with coarse linen, the texture of which is still clearly defined
on the coating of verd antique with which it is now covered. But its
peculiar features consist of an elevated central ornament resembling
a crown, and four intricately chased projections terminating in horses'
heads. It was found in September 1786, along with another brooch
of the same kind, lying beside a skeleton, under a flat stone, very
near the surface, above the ruins of a Pictish house or burgh, in
Caithness. It measures nearly four and a half inches in length, by
three inches in breadth, and two and two-fifth inches in height to the
top of the crown. Like many others of the same type, it appears to
have been jewelled. In several examples of these brooches which I
have compared, the lower convex plates so nearly resemble each other,
as to suggest the probability of their having been cast in the same
mould, while the upper plates entirely differ.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 597px;">
<img src="images/image523.jpg" width="597" height="352" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These oval brooches are most frequently found in pairs, and may
be presumed to have been worn on the front of the shoulders or
breast, as shewn in a curious piece of sculpture, evidently of nearly
the same period, which is built into the church wall of Invergowrie.
It is engraved in Mr. Chalmers of Auldbar's "Ancient Sculptured
Monuments of Angus," (<i>Pl.</i> XXII.) and represents, apparently, three
dignitaries, probably priests, as two of them hold books in their
hands. The two outer figures are adorned with large brooches on
their shoulders, while the central, and perhaps more important figure,
is without them, but wears instead a circular ornament on the lower
front of his garment. Along with the pairs of oval brooches is fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>quently
found a third, flat and sometimes trefoiled. One of these,
referred to more particularly on a subsequent page, found along with
a pair of oval brooches, in a barrow on the Island of Westray, in 1839,
was first observed on the exposure of
the skeleton, apparently laid on the
abdomen, while the others were beside
the ribs, as if worn on the breast.
Another example from the Island of
Sangay is figured in the Vetusta Monumenta,
(vol. ii. <i>Pl.</i> XX.) A beautiful
pair, made of a white-coloured
metal, found under peculiar circumstances
in a tumulus in Yorkshire,
and another from the neighbourhood
of Bedale, are figured in the Archæological
Journal.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Various other specimens
are preserved, both in public and
private collections, but none of those
that I have seen appear to equal in
elaborateness or beauty of design, the Caithness brooch figured above.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/image524.jpg" width="375" height="549" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Sculpture at Invergowrie.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By far the most remarkable relic associated with the period of
Scandinavian invasion yet discovered in Scotland, is the beautiful
Runic brooch, engraved on <i>Plate</i> I., which forms the frontispiece to
this volume. It was found in the autumn of 1830, on the estate of
Robert Hunter, Esq. of Hunterston, in the parish of West Kilbride,
Ayrshire, within about an hundred yards of the sea, by two workmen
who had commenced to quarry for stones. It lay quite close to the
surface, at the foot of a steep cliff, called the "Hawking Craig," where
the falcon still breeds,&mdash;a part of the Goldenberry hill, which bounds
the extreme western point of Ayrshire. Between the Hawking Craig
and the sea is a level piece of ground, where local tradition affirms
that a skirmish took place, shortly before the celebrated battle of
Largs, fought <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1263,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> when the fleet of King Haco was shattered
by a tempest, and the Norse foe, already dispirited and greatly reduced
in numbers, was totally routed, and finally driven from the
Scottish mainland. In further confirmation of the local tradition Mr.
Hunter adds,&mdash;"On the opposite side of the Hawking Craig, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>the brooch was found, I discovered, in making a fence, some graves,
composed merely of six rough stones, but with nothing inside but
some charcoal, the bones being quite decayed. A short distance from
this, at the foot of the hill, is the flat piece of ground assigned as the
scene of the skirmish, in confirmation of which I discovered some
graves there. A short way from this was a large cairn or tumulus of
stones, wherein were found coins, &amp;c.; but I just recollect, as a boy,
the stones having been carted away: I found also an urn of unbaked
clay, half filled with bones partially burned." It might admit of
doubt if the Norsemen were likely to tarry on an enemy's coast, after
so decisive a defeat, long enough to construct the cist and cinerary
urn, and to rear the funeral pile, though we know that they were
permitted to land, after the battle of Largs, in order to bury their
dead. But we may dispense with the argument in this case, as we
have not the slightest reason to imagine that the cinerary urn was in
use, either by Scots or Norwegians, of the thirteenth century. In
truth, the whole theory by which the remarkable relic now referred
to is sought to be connected with the important historical event of
the reign of Alexander III., is destitute of any satisfactory foundation.
The locality is far removed from Largs, and not the slightest
value can be attached to any local tradition of Norwegian skirmishes
or battles. A reference to the old and new statistical accounts of the
various parishes, along both the Ayrshire and Argyleshire coasts, will
suffice to shew that the battle of King Haco has proved as infallible
a source of explanation for the discovery of cists, tumuli, cairns, and
sepulchral relics of every kind, as if it were a well authenticated fact
that no one had died, from the days of Noah to our own, but at the
battle of Largs!</p>

<p>Sturla, the Norse skald, has celebrated the gorgeous armament of
Haco in the famous Raven's Ode, and disguises the extent of his
monarch's defeat with the skill of a courtly bard; but in vain. King
Haco gathered together the shattered remnant of his fleet, and bore
away for Orkney, where he died, not many weeks after, of a broken
heart. The old Norse skald thus refers to his earlier success, while
the fleet was gathering along the Scottish shores, in sight of the Ayrshire
coast:&mdash;"Our fierce veterans, feeders of wolves, hastened their
fatal course through the mountains. In the fell battle mingling,
Aleinn the Dauntless wreaked vengeance on the expiring foe. But
now our sovereign encountered the horrid powers of enchantment. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
tempest, magic-raised, blew upon our warriors ambitious of conquest,
and against the floating habitations of the brave. The roaring billows
dashed shielded companies on the Scottish strand."</p>

<p>In one of the skirmishes which preceded the fatal encounter fought
on Tuesday the 2d of October 1263, the beautiful brooch engraved on
<i>Plate</i> I. is assumed to have been lost. Both the character of its inscription
and the style of its ornament suggest the probability of its
pertaining to a much earlier period; and even Danish antiquaries,
while not unwilling to authenticate its Scandinavian origin, have
sought for it a date one hundred and thirty-three years prior to the
defeat of King Haco, and the final abandonment of the Scottish
mainland by the Norwegian invader. The brooch is of silver, richly
wrought with gold filigree work, and measures four inches and nine-tenths
in greatest diameter. It is also set with amber, and is in a nearly
perfect condition. The only injury it has received, with the exception
of the point of the acus being broken off, is in some of the amber settings,
occasioned either by the action of the weather, to which it was
exposed from lying so near the surface, or possibly from the frequent
burning of the whins which abound along the cliff where it was found.
But the most remarkable feature of this beautiful personal ornament
is an inscription engraved in large Runic characters on its under side.</p>

<p>Shortly after the discovery of this interesting relic, it was exhibited
to the Society of Scottish Antiquaries, and Mr. T. G. Repp, a native
of Iceland, familiar with Runic literature, read the inscription thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 609px;">
<img src="images/image526.jpg" width="609" height="38" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>&#5848;&#5830;&#5850;&#5806;&#5809;&#5825;&#5798;&#5830;&#5868;&#5830;&#5868;&#5840;&#5830;&#5850;&#5812;&#5868;&#5798;&#5825;&#5837;&#5868;&#5868;&#5840;&#5805;&#5850;&#5812;&#5868;&#5805;&#5837;&#5792;&#5809;&#5825;&#5841;&#5805;&#5868;</p></div>
</div>

<p>Maloritha &aacute; dalk this; D&oacute;lk Osfri&#273;o; which he thus translated:
Maloritha possidet hanc fibulam; Fibula Osfridie. At the same
time drawings of the brooch were made, and a cast in sulphur was
taken from the inscription, which is now deposited in the Museum of
the Scottish Antiquaries. This valuable historic relic, which is here
for the first time presented to British archæologists, has attracted
considerable attention among Danish antiquaries. It was made the
subject of a learned communication by Finn Magnusen, in the <i>Annaler</i>
<i>for Nordisk Oldkyndighed og Historie</i> for 1846, (pp. 323-599,) but
it admits of doubt if he has been more successful in the correct rendering
of this than of the well-known Runamo or Ruthwell inscriptions,
though he is equally precise in assigning to our Ayrshire brooch a
definite date and owner, as in identifying Offa, and the other historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
characters of whom mention is made, according to certain readings of
the Ruthwell Runes.</p>

<p>The inscription on the brooch is traced in large Runic characters,
of which an exact fac-simile is introduced in the frontispiece, and differs
essentially from any readings hitherto given of it by Danish antiquaries.
Professor Magnusen's version, furnished by the late Mr.
Donald Gregory, then Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,
was probably only a copy of that made by Mr. Repp, though he
reads the second name &#5806;&#5837;&#5792;&#5809;&#5825;&#5840;&#5805;, and contrives to elicit a vast deal
more significance from the brief legend than its former translator
dreamt of. He renders the first part&mdash;<span class="smcap">MALFRI&THORN;A A DALK &THORN;IS</span>; and
translates it, <i>Malfritha is the owner of this brooch</i>. In this Malfritha
he ingeniously discovers the Norwegian Queen Malford, a Russian
princess who lived about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1130, while he finds in the Osfrido of
the latter part of his version, Astrith the wife of King Svenir. A
passage, moreover, in the Saga of King Haco, wherein the monarch
complains of having been despoiled in infancy of all his inheritance
save a brooch and a ring, completed the coveted cycle of historical
identification, and here accordingly we have the brooch of King Haco,
and an undoubted memorial of the Battle of Largs! A glance at the
fac-simile of the inscription will shew how much imagination had to do
even with the literal elements of this unparalleled discovery. In
adapting the first name to his historical romance, Professor Magnusen
reads &#5806; as F, not only without any authority, but even while recognising
the regular &#5792;, or Runic F, in the second name&mdash;a needless
liberty as will appear. The word &#5798;&#5825;&#5837; is no less a creation of the fancy.
The mark which appears to have been construed into the terminating
circle of the &#5837;, and to have given some show of probability to the
others, being only the head of one of the silver rivets, which chances
there to protrude in the middle of a line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us glance at the safer guidance which pure archæological
evidence supplies. In addition to the inscription, I have introduced
in the drawing, portions of the ornamental borders running
along the outer and inner edges of the brooch. The Irish antiquary
especially will recognise in these the familiar interlaced patterns to
be found on nearly every native ecclesiastical and personal ornament
pertaining to the early Christian period prior to the first appearance
of the Northern Vikings, and with these the entire design and ornamentation
correspond. But for the inscription, in fact, no one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
have dreamt of assigning to the brooch a foreign origin; yet it
does not seem to have ever occurred to the Scottish antiquaries to
whom it was submitted, that the inscription might also be native, and
equally Celtic with the workmanship. It will be seen that a rude
chevron pattern is engraved on the back of the brooch, cut in the
same style as the inscription, evidently the work of very different, and
no doubt later hands, than those of the original jeweller. The whole
reasoning, both of Scottish and Danish antiquaries in relation to this
interesting relic, has heretofore proceeded on the assumption that a
Runic inscription must have a direct Scandinavian origin: a conclusion
by no means necessarily resulting from the use of Runes in Scotland
at the date assigned to this one, after alliances and intermarriages
had long existed between the Scandinavian and Celtic races
of Scotland.</p>

<p>The Runic monuments of the Isle of Man present some remarkable
features, manifestly pointing them out as the product of a Scandinavian
colony in close alliance with a native Celtic population, and possessed
both of a language and style of art resulting from the intercourse
of these diverse races. The Manx Runic alphabet appears also
to have some literal peculiarities altogether singular, though probably
once common to the Hebrides and Northern Isles, and found also, as
might have been anticipated, on the Hunterston brooch. To these
features of the Manx alphabet, my attention was called by Professor
P. A. Munch of Christiania, during the visit of that distinguished
Northern scholar to this country in 1849; by whom, indeed, they were
for the first time detected, when inspecting a series of casts of the
Manx inscriptions in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries. In
these &#5806; is sometimes used as B, so that the first name on the brooch
reads <i>Malbritha</i>. From the incidents already narrated relative to the
Scandinavian acquirement of possessions on the Scottish mainland,
both by conquest and marriage, it cannot be doubted that, in so far
as the Celtic race had any literary acquirements, they must have been
familiarized both with the Northern language and Runes. It need
not, therefore, surprise us to find in the owner of the Hunterston
brooch not a Norwegian queen but a Scottish chief of the same name
as the Celtic Maormor, Melbrigda T&ouml;nn, slain by Sigurd, the Orkney
jarl, when he invaded the north of Scotland <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 894. The name,
indeed, is familiar to the student of early Scottish history, and its
first syllable is one of the commonest Celtic prefixes, as in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span><i>Mail</i>
<i>Pataric</i> on the Iona tomb, and even in the royal name of Malcolm,
<i>Maol Columb</i>, the servant of Columba, as <i>Maol Brigda</i> signifies the
servant of St. Bridget. In all cases it is a male prefix, the Gaelic
<i>maol</i> meaning <i>bald</i> as well as <i>subordinate</i>, and being undoubtedly
employed in its latter acceptation with reference to the tonsure. It
is accordingly frequently met with in the names of ecclesiastics, as in
the Pictish chronicle, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 965, "<i>Maelbrigd episcopus pausavit,</i>" and
again repeatedly in an early Irish MS. copy of the Gospels, preserved
among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum,&mdash;n, 1802; as, for
example, at the end of the Gospel of St. John, the colophon, "Or. do
Maelbrigte h-Ua Maeluanaig, qui scripsit hunc librum."</p>

<p>Here, therefore, we have a probable key to the language of the
whole inscription, nor can it be regarded as an extravagant idea that
a Celt should write his native language in an alphabet already familiar
to him. The characters on the brooch, it will be seen, include
various <i>Binderuner</i> or compound Runes, which add to the difficulty
of translation. Making allowance for these, the following version has
this merit at least, compared with previous ones, that it does not select
merely such letters as will conform to a preconceived theory, but takes
the whole in natural order. In the latter part of the inscription the
second letter is a compound Rune, consisting of &#5829;&#5805;, or perhaps of
&#5825;&#5829;&#5805;, the next of &#5850;&#5833;, and the fourth of &#5830;&#5805;&mdash;a construction entirely in
accordance with the usual mode of interpreting the <i>Binderuner</i>,
which were in common use at the very period of the most intimate
Celtic and Scandinavian intercourse. The whole will thus read:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 604px;">
<img src="images/image529e.jpg" width="604" height="36" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>&#5848;&#5830;&#5850;&#5806;&#5809;&#5825;&#5798;&#5830;&#5868;&#5830;&#5868;&#5840;&#5830;&#5825;&#5848;&#5825;&#5820;&#5826;&#5820;&#5868;&#5825;&#5868;&#5840;&#5829;&#5805;&#5850;&#5868;&#5848;&#5830;&#5805;&#5850;&#5792;&#5809;&#5825;&#5840;&#5825;</p></div>
</div>

<p>The additional marks are mostly irregular lines, with no distinctive
character, and executed with so little care, that it is not improbable
they have been introduced merely to occupy the remaining space with
a uniform texture. What is decipherable reads in good Scottish
Celtic: <i>Malbritha a daimiheh i dæol Maolfridi</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, Malbritha his
friend in recompense to Maolfridi: <i>a</i> is the possessive pronoun <i>his</i>;
<i>daimheach</i>, a friend or relative; <i>i</i> or <i>h-i</i>, the old Celtic preposition
<i>in</i>; and <i>d&igrave;ol</i>, a reward for service done. It must be borne in remembrance
that the spelling of the Scottish Gaelic is entirely modern.
It is the sound therefore that is chiefly to be looked to, but the variations
even in the spelling are not important. No Scandinavian scholar
can examine the fac-simile of the inscription, and question the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
that the concluding portion actually contains the masculine name
which Professor Magnusen was at such needless pains to try and
educe from that of Malbritha. The chief value, however, to the
Scottish antiquary of the reading now given, arises from no identification
of these old Celtic friends, but from its establishing the fact&mdash;in
itself so probable&mdash;that they did actually employ the Scoto-Scandinavian
Runes in writing their own native language.</p>

<p>The annexed woodcut represents an exceedingly beautiful Scottish
brooch, the size of the original, now in
the collection of John Bell, Esq. of Dungannon.
Like the Hunterston brooch,
it is of silver, set with amber, and with
the pattern wrought in gold. The resemblance
of the two, both in style of
ornament and in some of the details,
can hardly fail to be admitted. This
very fine specimen was found in the
immediate vicinity of the celebrated
mounds of Dunipace, Stirlingshire, the subject of
antiquarian speculation from the days of Buchanan
to our own. Another very fine large silver
brooch, jewelled and plated with gold, formerly
in the celebrated collection of Major Sirr, and
now in that of C. K. Sharpe, Esq., has the acus
exactly corresponding in its form and peculiar
construction to that of the Hunterston brooch,
while its other details are such as Scottish and
Irish antiquaries are familiar with on the native
gold and silver work of Celtic Christian art prior
to the eleventh century. In point of workmanship
and style of art, therefore, we have no reason
to ascribe to our Runic brooch a foreign origin.
Other evidence equally exposes the fallacy of assuming
a necessary connexion between the discovery
of Runes on our western coast and the fatal expedition of King Haco.</p>

<p>Directly opposite to the Ayrshire coast, and within sight of the Bay of
Largs, a small island protects the entrance to Lamlash Bay, in the Isle
of Arran, the well-known anchorage where Haco mustered his shattered
fleet after his overthrow. In the Norwegian account of the expe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>dition,
after the narration of the fatal storm and conflict, it is stated,
"The king sailed past Kumbrey (Cumbray) to Melansay, where he lay
some nights."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> This Melans ey, or isle, there can be little doubt is
Holy Island, in the Bay of Lamlash, which contains the cave assigned
by immemorial tradition as the residence of St. Molio or St. Maoliosa,
a disciple of Columba, and a favourite Celtic saint. The island corresponds
in geological structure to the southern district of Arran, presenting
along the shore the common red sandstone strata, overflowed
by a great mass of claystone and claystone porphyry, which towers
above it in rugged and picturesque cliffs, fringed by the dwarf oak
and birch, to a height of about a thousand feet. The cave of St. Molio
is little more than a waterworn recess in the sandstone rock at an elevation
of about thirty feet from the present level of the sea. On the
shore below, a circular well is pointed out as St. Molio's Bath, and a
large block of sandstone cut perfectly flat on the top, and surrounded
with a series of artificial recesses or seats, bears the name of the
Saint's Chair. Such relics are by no means rare in Scotland. They
appear to have been singularly characteristic of Celtic hagiology. The
Bath of St. Cuthbert was once a favourite resort in Strathtay; that
of St. Woloc exists in Strathdeveron; and that of St. Fillan remains
in the strath of Perthshire which still bears his name. St. Kentigern
also had once his "bath," "bed," and "chair," near the Molendinar
Burn. The Stone Chair of St. Marnan is still at Aberchirder; that
of St. Fillan was recently preserved at the Mill of Killin; while
another of these singular Celtic relics, placed at a commanding point,
near Achtereachan, Glencoe, where a bend of the glen enables it to
command both views, bears the name of <i>Cathair Malvina</i>, or the Chair
of Malvina, one of Ossian's heroines.</p>

<p>The roof and sides of the cave of St. Molio, on Holy Island, are
covered with rude marks and inscriptions of many different periods,
among which may be discerned the following Runic inscription, cut
with great regularity, in characters of about an inch and a half in
length.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 554px;">
<img src="images/image531a.jpg" width="554" height="70" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>&#10060; &#5823;&#5825;&#5812;&#5794;&#5850;&#5806;&#5836;&#8285;&#5830;&#5820;&#5829;&#5823;&#5826;&#8285;&#5809;&#5829;&#5825;&#5836;&#5840;&#5867;</p></div>
</div>

<p>The reading is sufficiently simple and unmistakable. <i>Nikulos ahane</i>
<i>raist</i>. The first, &#5823;&#5825;&#5812;&#5794;&#5850;&#5806;&#5836;, is manifestly a proper name. No such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
word as &#5830;&#5820;&#5829;&#5823;&#5826; is known in the Icelandic or ancient Norse tongue,
unless it be simply <i>a Hane</i>: of Hane, the name of a place. We may
therefore, perhaps, without impropriety, look for it in the native
Celtic, where <i>abhadh</i>, pronounced very nearly in accordance with the
spelling of <i>ahane</i>, signifies a hollow or abode. The last word, &#5809;&#5829;&#5825;&#5836;&#5840;,
is of common occurrence in Runic inscriptions, the preterite of <i>r&iacute;sta,</i>
<i>to engrave</i>. In the present example, therefore, we shall not probably
err in reading the inscription <i>Nicholas engraved, or cut, this cave</i>.</p>

<p>According to established custom with all relics found in the neighbourhood
of the estuary of the Clyde, possessing the slightest affinity
to those of ancient Scandinavia, this Runic inscription will no doubt
be ascribed to the followers of King Haco in the thirteenth century.
But independently of the improbability of the defeated Norsemen
employing themselves in inscribing such a retreat, the simplicity of
the Runes favours the probability of its pertaining to an earlier period.
It is not altogether impossible, however, that even now, after
the lapse of at least six centuries, we may be able from the brief
Runes of St. Molio's Cave, to identify the anchorite who dwelt in this
rude retreat. From the initial &#10016;, the inscription appears to be the
work of an ecclesiastic; and in the Chronicon Manniæ, after recording
the death of Bishop Michael, the elevation of his successor
Nicholas, a native of Argyle, is thus noted: Huic successit Nicolaus
Archadiensis genere, qui jacet in monasterio Benchorensi.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> He
appears to have succeeded to the see about the year 1193, and to
have held it for about fourteen years.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The coincidence both of name
and place of nativity certainly give probability to the supposition that
the recluse of Holy Island in the bay of Lamlash, and the old Manx
bishop, may have been one; at the same time it must be observed
that such attempts at identification rest on an extremely uncertain
basis, and have been the fruitful source of error.</p>

<p>The traces of the use of Runic characters are still abundant in the
Isle of Man, and undoubtedly belong to the period of the general
adoption of Christianity there, though it is not possible to assign to
them a precise date. But the above are not the only Runes inscribed
on St. Molio's cave. The whole surrounding surface of the rock is
covered with crosses, evidently the marks of pious but illiterate pilgrims,
who thus recorded their visit to the Holy Isle. Among these,
however, are also traceable initials, monograms, and other more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>perfect evidences of the former concourse of pilgrims to the sacred
spot. The annexed fac-simile of a group of them shews the curious
character of these primitive holographs; but among them the experienced
eye will at once discern the Runic characters, not regularly
and boldly cut as in the former inscription, but irregularly scratched,
as with the hasty hand of the wayfaring pilgrim. It is hardly necessary
now too curiously to investigate the primitive record, though the
letters are for the most part sufficiently distinct and well defined.
The &#5811;, or <i>k</i>, is not a Scandinavian but an Anglo-Saxon Rune: a mixture
by no means improbable by a Celtic inscriber. The whole probably
imply no more than the proper name <i>Akiethir</i>, though it does
not present, as in the former case, one familiar to our ears. Possibly
like some other Runic inscriptions, it reads from right to left, in which
case we should perhaps recognise it as a female name, <i>Ritheika</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 629px;">
<img src="images/image533a.jpg" width="629" height="194" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Runic Inscription in St. Molio's Cave.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rounded Roman characters, from which the medieval church-lettering
ultimately sprung, were in use in the North more than a
century prior to the era of King Haco, though they had not entirely
superseded the Runes. But before this took place the Runic alphabet
had been augmented by various new characters, and the <i>Binderuner</i>,
or compound Runes, were in general use, especially in proper names,
many of which are united into a single monogram. Both of the inscriptions
in St. Molio's Cave are free from the later abridged mode
of writing, and would therefore seem more probably ascribable to an
older date than the thirteenth century, or indeed the not greatly
earlier era of Bishop Nicholas of Man.</p>

<p>In this conclusion Scandinavian scholars will probably concur, though
they may perhaps detect in other undecipherable groups of markings
on the same cave the characteristic <i>Binderuner</i> of a later date. It can
hardly be expected that they will unhesitatingly concur in another
idea, advanced I believe for the first time, that the Celtic population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
of Scotland were as familiar with the Northern Runes as the natives
of the kingdom of Northumbria are proved to have been with the
Anglo-Saxon Runes, in which the most remarkable Scottish Runic
monument&mdash;the Cross of Ruthwell&mdash;is inscribed. Of this, however,
we are not entirely without some direct indications. The earliest, if
not indeed the only medieval Scottish document which contains any
allusion to the Pictish race, is a charter of confirmation of the lands
of Burgie, in the reign of Alexander II., which occurs in the Chartulary
of Moray. In describing the marches of the lands of Burgie, as
fixed by perambulation, it refers to the various landmarks as follows:
"Scilicet a magna quercu in Malevin quam predictus comes Malcolumo
primo fecit cruce signari usque ad <i>Rune Pictorum</i>, et inde usque
ad <i>Tubernacrumkel</i>, et inde per sicum usque ad <i>Tubernafein</i>, et inde
usque ad <i>Runetwethel</i>, et inde per rivulam qui currit per meresiam
usque ad vadum quod dicitur <i>Blakeford</i>, quod est inter Burgyn et
Ulern."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> To this interesting and curious charter another parchment
is attached, which professes to furnish an explanation of the local
names. They contain, it will be observed, an admixture of Celtic
and Saxon terminology, sufficiently characteristic of the previous
history of the locality; and the explanatory parchment is chiefly
valuable as shewing how effectually the intrusion of the later race
had adulterated or effaced the native traditions. The following
is the explanatory translation:&mdash;"<i>Rune[s] Pictorum</i>, the carne
of the Pethis, or the Pecht's fieldis. <i>Tubernacrumkel</i>, ane well
with ane thrawine mowth, or ane cassin well, or ane crwik in it."
It is sufficiently obvious that the explanations are given with uncertainty
and doubt, and there can be little hesitation in translating
the first name, not as the Pictish fields, but as the Pictish Runes,
referring, as may be assumed, to an inscribed Celtic monument which
had of old marked one of the Burgie marches; though in the reign of
Alexander II., and long prior to the Battle of Largs, the very meaning
of the term had been forgotten in Scotland. No attempt is made
in the Burgie parchment to explain the name <i>Runetwethel</i>, but its
correspondence to that of Ruthwell, the site of the celebrated Runic
monument in Dumfriesshire, is perhaps not unworthy of notice.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>form of the northern Runes, as of the eastern Cuneatic characters,
is manifestly traceable to a people whose literature was confined to
graven records, chiefly on stone. Many of the medieval mason's
marks are not only similar in general form, but some of them are
identical with the following characters of the Runic alphabets:&mdash;&#5818;&#5835;&#5855;&#5819;&#5801;&#5846;&#5854;&#5848;&#5815;&#5847;&#5862;
While this correspondence may be sufficiently
explained by the simplicity of such combinations of lines, and their
ready execution by the mason's <i>pen</i>, the absence of rounded forms,
such as predominate in the Roman alphabet, adds another proof
that the origin of medieval architecture, and perhaps also of Free
Masonry, is traceable to the northern countries of Europe. The
medieval mason's marks may undoubtedly be assumed with equal
probability to retain the traces of the obsolete Runes, as the <i>Bom&#339;rker</i>
(literally house-marks) employed by the peasantry in certain
districts of Sweden and Norway as signatures, or marks on personal
property, in which the northern antiquaries recognise surviving elements
of the Runic alphabet. In more recent times the term <i>Runic</i>
has been used in this country in the vaguest and most uncertain
fashion, occasionally without any very definite meaning appearing to
be attached to it, and not infrequently as synonymous with Danish
or Scandinavian.</p>

<p>These indications of the use of Runes by the native Celtic population
of Scotland, are&mdash;like many other ideas advanced in this elementary
treatise on our national antiquities&mdash;offered suggestively,
and liable to the correction which further discoveries may suggest.
The Celtic character of the name on the Hunterston brooch, the
equally familiar one, in its Greek form, of that in the cave of St.
Molio&mdash;peculiarly characteristic of the native Christian ascetics prior
to the eleventh century,&mdash;and the Runic characters mingling with
the initials and pilgrims' marks of the Holy Isle, are all suggestive
of the same idea; and this it will be seen receives further confirmation
from other Runic inscriptions. But whatever conclusion be
finally adopted as to the precise rendering of the Hunterston inscription,
or the inferences to be drawn from the various Runic memorials
found in Scotland, it will be universally acknowledged that the brooch
on which the former occurs is a relic of no ordinary interest or value.
Though it may not admit of comparison with the celebrated golden
horns, it surpasses, I believe, any other inscribed Runic relic hitherto
discovered in Denmark or Sweden. A gold head ring found a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
years since at Starup, in the neighbourhood of Haderslev, with Runic
letters upon it, is engraved in Mr. Worsaae's Primeval Antiquities of
Denmark. The inscription is simply the word <i>lu&thorn;ro</i>, traced on the
inner side of the ring, and assumed as probably denoting the name of
the owner, which in this case also is supposed to be that of a man.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>While the Isle of Man still retains many interesting traces of Scandinavian
influence, in its memorial crosses graven with inscriptions
in the Northern Runes, it is surprising how very partial are the
indications of the same influence in the older northern jarldom.
Only two imperfect Runic inscriptions have been observed in Shetland,
and are described by Dr. Hibbert from drawings by Mr. Low.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
One of them on a slab or grave-stone at Crosskirk, in Northmavine,
is too much mutilated to render any attempt at restoration or decipherment
of its meaning possible. The other was fixed in the wall
of the Parish Church of Sandness, where it probably still remains;
but, if there be no error in Dr. Hibbert's engraving of it, it only adds
another to the frequent examples in Scotland of the term <i>Runic</i>
being applied to designate any strange or incomprehensible device on
a sepulchral monument. In Orkney no Runic monument is known
to exist, though it cannot be doubted that many such must have
been erected during the earlier years of the independent occupation
of the Northern Islands by the Norwegian Jarls. Some of these, it
is not impossible, may even yet be brought to light; though the
continuous presence of a busy population during the intervening centuries
affords too satisfactory means of accounting for their destruction
to render such discoveries very probable at this late date. The
annexed illustration of a later and more complicated Runic inscription
than any known British example, is the remarkable memorial
stone found in 1824 on the Island of Kingiktorsoak, Greenland,
under the parallel of 73&deg;, proving the zeal with which the old Scandinavian
colonists pushed their adventurous course even to the extreme
north of the inhospitable region of Greenland. It is introduced
here chiefly to shew the complicated and much more intricate
character of Scandinavian inscriptions of a later and well ascertained
period; the era of the colonisation of Greenland being sufficiently
established as a historical fact. Mr. C. C. Rafn finds in the concluding
Runes the date 1135. During the recent repairs executed on
St. Magnus Cathedral at Kirkwall, some singularly interesting dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>coveries
were made connected with the period of its earliest Scandinavian
bishops. A tomb was opened accidentally in the choir of the
cathedral, which from the inscription accompanying it appears to
have been the place to which the remains of William, according to
Torfæus, first resident Bishop of Orkney, were translated, after the
elongation of the cathedral, towards the close of the twelfth century.
Along with the bones were interred a leaden plate inscribed in the
common Church letters of the period:&mdash;<span class="antiqua">H. Requiescit. Williamus.
Senex. felicis. memorie</span>. On the reverse of the plate are the words,
<span class="antiqua">pmus epis</span>. Further excavations in the east end of the choir, and
close to the presumed site of the high altar, led to the discovery of two
curious pieces of sculpture, in bas relief, representing <span class="smcap">St. Olaf</span> and
<span class="smcap">St. Magnus</span>. These, however, as well as the tomb of Bishop Tulloch,
with crosier, paten, and chalice inclosed, and other discoveries made
at the same period, belong to a later era than that of Runic literature,
and are only referred to now as suggesting the possibility of
still earlier relics of the Scandinavian period of Orcadian history
being yet brought to light, while the first of them shews that the
Runic character had fallen into disuse soon after the introduction of
Christianity in the north.</p>

<p>It is to the Manx monuments, however, that we must turn for the
most distinct and abundant traces of Scandinavian influence, though
modified both by the arts and the faith of the older Celtic population.
The Runic inscriptions are conjoined with the sacred emblem of the
Christian faith, and are associated with ornamental accompaniments,
some of which are sufficiently common on the sculptured memorials
of the Scottish mainland and isles, though never found on contemporary
native monuments of Scandinavia. The close resemblance of
a peculiar trefoil ornament on the upper part of one of these crosses
at Kirk Michael, to the device on the reverse of the coins of Aulaf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
King of Northumbria, has been pointed out;<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> but it is impossible to
limit to a single country or to a very narrow period much of the
common ornamentation vulgarly called Runic knotwork. It may
be traced on manuscripts, monuments, and relics of Scoto-Irish,
Pictish, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman origin, from the
sixth to the twelfth century. It is, however, frequently found with
other accompaniments of a more precise character, and this in the case
of the Manx crosses of Kirk Andreas and Kirk Michael, approaches
more nearly to the style of the singular sculptured standing stones
of Scotland than to any other monuments of the north of Europe.
Here, therefore, sheltered by the isolation of this island, and by the
veneration or by the superstition of its inhabitants, examples have
been preserved of the style of Scoto-Norwegian monuments of the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, which must once have abounded in
the Scottish Northern and Western Isles, and on those parts of the
mainland longest subject to Scandinavian rule. "The fear of sacrilege
evinced by the Manx peasants is very great. The ruined chapels
are still venerated, and a Manx formula of cursing is,&mdash;May a stone
of the church be found in a corner of your house."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> That the monuments
of this period should have disappeared cannot surprise us,
when we reflect on the very few memorials we now possess of that
important era of Scottish ecclesiastical history which intervenes
between the building of the white-walled cathedral of St. Ninian at
Whithern, about the year 412, and the founding of the Abbey of
Dunfermline in the eleventh century. I am fortunate in having obtained
the assistance of Professor P. A. Munch&mdash;whose name will,
I believe, be sufficient authority among northern scholars&mdash;in translating
such of the Manx monuments as are referred to here. Previous
transcriptions made by copyists unfamiliar with the Runic
characters, or ignorant of the language in which they are inscribed,
have added much uncertainty and obscurity to the subject, and produced
so many various readings as to bring the whole inquiry into
disrepute.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>At Kirk Andreas, near Ramsey, at Kirk Michael, Kirk Bride, Kirk
Maughold, and Balsalla, are various of these interesting memorials of

of the faith of the period, and even furnishing some curious
personal information regarding the men of that time. Not the least
interesting of these minute records is that supplied by the inscription
on one of the Kirk Michael crosses, already referred to:&mdash;</p>

style of the Scottish memorial stones, and decorated with a variety of
sculptured figures and animals, representing a stag hunt. One of the
edges is ornamented with interlaced work, as shewn in the annexed

with a small incised figure of a warrior in simple costume, with his
arms extended, holding a spear in his right hand, and bearing a round
shield on the left arm. The letters are sharply cut, and the author
of "Ecclesiological Notes on the Isle of Man" refers to this as the
most perfect Runic inscription in the three kingdoms:&mdash;</p>

<p>Its literal rendering is:&mdash;Auolfir sunr &thorn;urulfs hins rau&thorn;a risti krus
&thorn;ana aft fri&thorn;u mu&thorn;ur sina; betraying
like the others the variations of a provincial
dialect, or a foreign use of the
old Norse tongue. More correctly it
is:&mdash;Eyolfr sunr &thorn;&oacute;rolfs hins rau&eth;a
reisti kross &thorn;enna eft Fri&eth;u m&oacute;&eth;ur
s&iacute;na; <i>i.e.</i>, Eyolf, the son of Thorolf the
Red, raised this cross after (or in memory
of) Frida his mother. This exceedingly
simple memorial of affection,
contrasting in its brevity so strikingly
with the inflated extravagancies of
modern monumental inscriptions, affords
a good example of the most
usual style of the Manx Runic legends.
One cross at Kirk Andreas is raised
by Sandulfr suarte, or Sandulf the
Black, in memory of his sons and
wife; while on another imperfect fragment
of a cross may still be traced the
words:&mdash;Oskitil uilti i trigu ai&thorn;suara
sinn; <i>i.e.</i>, Oskitil betrayed in truce his
sworn friend. The precise object of
this unusual memorial cannot now be
guessed at with any degree of certainty,
though the fragment preserves
sufficient that is peculiar to excite our
regret at its recovery in so imperfect
and dubious a state. Another mutilated cross at Kirk Michael is interesting
as an additional example of a Runic inscription containing
names essentially Celtic in character. Part of the inscription is so
much defaced by the weather as to baffle any attempt at a consistent
rendering of its meaning, but of the portion copied below no doubt
can be entertained. It is presented here in fac-simile, as an illustration
of the style of engraving of the Manx inscriptions, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
differs in the use of &#5835;&#5839; for the more common Runic characters introduced

<p>The inscription literally reads:&mdash;Mal-lymkun raisti krus thana eftir
Mal-muru fustra sun; <i>i.e.</i>, Mallymcun raised this cross, after Malmor
his foster-son. The frequent allusions in Runic inscriptions to the
foster-father, brother, or son, shews the singular estimation in which
such peculiar ties of adopted relationship were held by the northern
races at that early date, as they have continued to be even to our
own day among the Scottish Highlanders. But the most thoroughly
Scandinavian in character of all the Manx Runic crosses is the
beautiful one which stands in the churchyard at Kirk Braddan.
I am not aware if crosses of this form are found in Denmark or
Norway, but in nearly all the principal details, especially on the
shaft, it differs entirely from the other Manx crosses, and corresponds
to those on Scandinavian relics of the Iron Period. It has been
broken in two, and otherwise mutilated; but the two principal pieces
have been clasped together with iron bands, so that a good idea can
still be formed of it in its perfect state. The shaft is decorated with
the common dragon ornaments, intricately intertwined over its whole
surface; thus greatly differing in style from the Runic crosses wrought
by the skilful hands of Gaut, as well as from the contemporary standing
stones of the Scottish mainland. This, therefore, we may be
justified in assuming, is the work of some Norwegian artist, whose
style was derived from his own fatherland, though in some degree
modified by the favourite models of Celtic art which have influenced
the form of other Christian monuments in the island. It is probably
one of the latest of all the Runic memorials in Man, while at the
same time it presents the Scandinavian characters accompanying a
style of art to some extent derived from the same foreign source. It
can hardly indeed admit of doubt, that in some at least of the Manx
monuments we must recognise the adaptation of the Norse literature
and dialect to native memorials. The cross cut in relief on the flat
slab, with the subordinate accompaniments illustrative of feats of
war or the chase, appear to be peculiarly characteristic of primitive
Pictish art; while the perforated head with interlaced ornamentation,
such as that which is here associated with the old dragon pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
and other Pagan devices of Scandinavia, is more directly traceable
to the early Christian arts of Celtic Ireland. The Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland possesses a complete cast of this beautiful cross,
taken when the iron clamps were removed for the purpose of being
renewed, and which thus supplies a portion of the Runic inscription
which can no longer be seen. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

In addition to this the following marks occur

of Camden, and elsewhere.
The Runic &#5794; appears to be used in its literal sense,
and the remainder may be assumed as rude
attempts at Roman characters, in which
case I think there can be little hesitation in
reading it as the sacred name <span class="smcap">IHESVS</span>&mdash;a
curious example of the transition from the
use of Runes to Roman characters.</p>

<p>It has already been noted that the term
Runic is used in Scotland in the vaguest
sense, being frequently understood as synonymous
with Scandinavian. In the account
of St. Madoes' Parish, Perthshire, for
example, we read: "In the churchyard there
is a very beautiful specimen of that class of
monuments called Runic, from their imagined
Norse or Danish origin." It may be perhaps assumed that
another stone in the parish of Anwoth, Kirkcudbrightshire, has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
better claims to rank among the Runic monuments of Scotland, notwithstanding
that the older Statist applies the name in reference to
its inscription. It is thus described in the Old Statistical Account of
the parish, along with a large moat which occupies a steep rocky
peninsula jutting out into the sea: "Near to this moat stands a thin
stone, nearly perpendicular, five feet three inches high, engraved on
both sides with the rude figure of a cross, accompanied with several
ornamental strokes, which some antiquaries suppose to be Runic inscriptions."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
But one other remarkable Runic monument remains to
be considered, surpassing in extent and importance any of those yet
described, and rendered not the less interesting from the very curious
literary controversy to which it has given rise. This is the celebrated
cross of Ruthwell, in Dumfriesshire, inscribed not in Northern
but Anglo-Saxon Runes. Like the few English examples yet discovered,
it is in the Northumbrian dialect of Anglo-Saxon, and
therefore is traceable, not to that northern intrusion of the Scandinavian
branch of the Teutonic races which we have hitherto considered,
and by which the old Celtic race of Scotland has been so
greatly modified, but to the influx of a Teutonic race from the
south, by which the Celtic occupants of the Scottish Lowlands
and the whole Northumbrian kingdom, were ultimately superseded.
Nevertheless the cross of Ruthwell may be referred to here without
any great risk of confusion, along with those inscribed in the old
Norse dialect; notwithstanding the justice of Mr. J. M. Kemble's
remarks, that "the characters of the Norwegians, Swedes, Danes,
and Icelanders, are not less distinct from those of the Goths, High
and Low Germans, and Anglo-Saxons, than the languages of the
several nations which they represented."<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> The Ruthwell cross is
unquestionably by far the most important Runic monument in Britain,
and has excited an attention fully equal to the great interest justly pertaining
to it. A beautiful engraving of this ancient monument in the
fourth volume of the Archæologia Scotica, accompanied with careful
fac-similes of its inscriptions, renders any minute description of it
superfluous.</p>

<p>Setting aside certain old and sufficiently vague local traditions recorded
in the first Statistical Account of the Parish of Ruthwell, we
obtain the earliest authentic notice of it only in the seventeenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>century, at which time it appears to have still remained in the parish
church, uninjured by any of those earlier ebullitions of misdirected
popular zeal to which so many Scottish relics of Christian art fell a
prey. When, however, the struggle between Charles I. and his
people was rapidly hastening to a crisis, and religious differences
were forced by many concurrent influences into violent collision, the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which
met at St. Andrews in the month of July 1642, passed an order
decreeing the demolition of the Ruthwell cross as a monument of
idolatry. The order met with a less hearty and thorough-going execution
than might have been anticipated from the spirit prevailing at
a period when the whole course of public events had tended to inflame
men's minds to the uttermost. The column, however, was thrown
down and broken in several pieces; but it still lay in the church,
and was examined there by Pennant so recently as 1772. Soon after
this, however, it was cast out into the churchyard, where its exposure
to weather, and its liability to careless and wanton mutilation, threatened
at length most effectually to accomplish the object of the St.
Andrews Assembly's Order of 1642, when fortunately the Rev. Dr.
Duncan was presented to the parish. Soon afterwards he had the
fragments of the venerable memorial pieced together, and re-erected
within the friendly shelter of the manse garden,&mdash;a monument to his
own good taste, with which his name will be associated by thousands
who know not the large-hearted benevolence and piety with which
he adorned the sacred office which he filled.</p>

<p>Not content, however, with merely restoring the venerable memorial,
Dr. Duncan executed careful drawings of it, from which the
engravings in the fourth volume of the Archæologia Scotica were
made. These are accompanied with a history from his pen, and an
accurate translation of the Latin inscription, which is cut in Roman
characters on the back and front of the cross. With the Runic inscription,
which occupies the remaining sides of the monument, Dr.
Duncan attempted no more than to furnish the Scottish antiquaries
with an accurate copy, leaving those who deemed themselves able for
the task to encounter its difficulties, and render an intelligible version
of its meaning. This was accordingly undertaken by Mr. Thorleif
G. Repp, a learned northern scholar, and a native of Iceland, then
resident in Edinburgh, who, reading the letters correctly enough, proceeded
to weave them into imaginary words and sentences, by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
of which he makes out the inscription to record "a gift for the expiation
of an injury, of a <i>cristpason</i> or baptismal fount, of eleven pounds
weight, made by the authority of the Therfusian fathers, for the devastation
of the fields." Other portions of the inscription were made
to supply the name of the devastated locality, "The dale of Ashlafr,"
a place as little heard of before as were its holy conservators, the
Monks of Therfuse! Dr. Duncan remarks, in furnishing an abstract of
Mr. Repp's rendering of the Ruthwell Runes,&mdash;"It is obvious that,
in future inquiries on this subject, it will be of considerable importance
to fix the locality of <i>Ashlafardhal</i> and <i>Therfuse</i>!" The accurate
drawings of Dr. Duncan, however, published as they were to the
learned world by the Scottish Antiquaries, had at length supplied the
most important desiderata towards the elucidation of the old Anglo-Saxon
memorial. Professor Finn Magnusen was the first to avail
himself of the new elements for the satisfactory investigation of this
venerable Teutonic relic, and published, in Danish, in the "Annaler
for Nordisk Oldkyndighed og Historie, 1836-37," and nearly at the
same time in English, in the "Report addressed by the Royal Society
of Northern Antiquaries to its British and American Members," a
revised version of the Ruthwell inscription, in which, while confirming
the somewhat startling opinion of Mr. Repp, that it was in a
language consisting both of Anglo-Saxon and old Northern words, he
arrives at very different, but still more precise conclusions. The learned
Dane, however, had obtained, as he conceived, a source of information
which not even the zealous incumbent of Ruthwell parish had access to.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Fortunately," says he, "we are in possession of what must be admitted to be
an important document in the case before us, a document the existence of which
was unknown as well to Mr. Repp as, to the best of our belief, to all others now
living, that have devoted attention to the monument in question. Dr. Duncan
observes that the capital of the column, which in the delineations he gives of it
shews no characters or traces of such, had, however, formerly inscriptions, now
quite illegible. The greater part of them, meanwhile, are found on a delineation of
the two broader sides of the said capital, which together with the two Runic sides of
the whole column, (consequently more of it than has been given by Hickes or
Gordon,) is to be seen on a large folio copperplate engraving, now the property of
me, Finn Magnusen. It was given to me some years ago by my much-lamented
friend and predecessor, Professor Thorkelin, who, however, his memory being impaired
by age, could not remember anything more about it than that it represented
a column in Scotland, and that he had obtained it, he knew not how or of whom,
during his travels in Britain."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

<p>This rare and indeed seemingly unique print Professor Magnusen
accordingly designates the "Thorkelin Engraving." Its age he conceives
must be about 150 years, or perhaps still older. "Be this as
it may," he adds, "it serves to throw a new and most important light&mdash;in
fact, the most important yet obtained&mdash;on the design and purpose
of the column, inasmuch as it has preserved the initial words of
its inscription, setting forth that one <i>Ofa</i>, a descendant of Voda, had
caused it to be cut," &amp;c. Accordingly, setting aside the humbler attempts
of Mr. Repp, the Danish professor substitutes a <i>marriage</i> for
the <i>devastation</i> of his predecessor, discovers four important historical
personages in the record, nearly fixes the precise year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 650 for
the handfasting, and altogether furnishes an entirely new chapter of
Anglo-Saxon history, based almost entirely on this Thorkelin print!
Some able northern scholars, more familiar with Anglo-Saxon literature
than Professor Magnusen, adopted the very summary process of
dealing with the new element thus unexpectedly brought to bear on
the inquiry, by doubting the authenticity, if not even the existence, of
this unique print. Of its existence, however, there can be no doubt,
since, instead of being the rarity which Professor Magnusen imagined,
it is to be found in every archæological library in the kingdom, being
none other (as I think will no longer be doubted) than one of two
etchings, executed by the well-known Scottish antiquary, Mr. Adam
de Cardonnel, and forming <i>Plates</i> LIV. and LV. of the Vetusta Monumenta,
vol. ii., published in 1789. These are accompanied by a
description furnished by R. G., (Roger Gale,) and to it the following
postscript has subsequently been added, which it will be seen supplies
the account Professor Magnusen failed to obtain from his aged friend:
"Since this account was read before the Society [of Antiquaries of
London,] the drawing has been shewn to Mr. Professor Thorkelin,
who has been investigating all such monuments of his countrymen
in this kingdom, but he has not returned any opinion." These engravings
of the Ruthwell inscription appear to have excited little
interest, probably on account of their being accompanied by no critical
analysis or attempt at translation. They would seem to have
escaped the notice of Mr. J. M. Kemble, otherwise he would have
found there all that the drawings of Dr. Duncan supply, with, indeed,
some slight additions; for it chances oddly enough that the old
Scottish Antiquary has copied the Anglo-Saxon Runes&mdash;about which
it may reasonably be doubted if he knew anything&mdash;a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
more correctly than the Latin inscription in familiar Roman characters,
some of which he has contrived to render totally unintelligible. It
was probably a result of this carelessness, that in arranging a broken
fragment of the top of the cross, along with the lower stem, he misplaced
the parts, wedding the imperfect upper fragments of the Latin,
to the remainder of the Anglo-Saxon inscription. The offspring of
this misalliance was the <i>Ofa, Voden's kinsman</i>, of Professor Magnusen,
whose double genealogy is given with amusing precision, "according
to the Younger Edda!" The slightest glance at Cardonnel's etchings
will shew that the learned Dane, in attempting to decipher this supposed
invaluable addition, was only torturing ill-copied Roman characters
into convenient Northern or Anglo-Saxon Runes.</p>

<p>In 1838, Mr. John M. Kemble, an English Anglo-Saxon scholar,
undertook to unwind this ravelled skein, and in an able paper "On
Anglo-Saxon Runes,"<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> pointed out the valuelessness of any amount
of knowledge of the Scandinavian languages as a means for deciphering
Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. Following out his own views he accordingly
produced a translation differing, <i>toto c&#339;lo</i>, from either of those
already referred to, but which commends itself in some degree even
to the mere English student, who detects in the old Anglo-Saxon
the radicals of his native tongue; as in the original of Mr. Repp's
<i>Cristpason</i>:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Krist waes on rodi</span>,&mdash;<i>Christ was on the Rood or Cross</i>.
Combating with the difficulties arising solely from the mutilated and
fragmentary state of what Mr. Kemble so justly styles "this noble
monument of Anglo-Saxon antiquity," he demonstrates the rhythmic
character of the construction, deducing from this the strongest proof
of the accuracy of his reading. Still should the reader, who is thus
compelled to consider two learned versions of this inscription as no
better than the Antiquary's <i>Agricola dicavit libens lubens</i>, hesitate
about accepting the third as less open to challenge, his scepticism
could not perhaps be greatly blamed. A remarkable chance, however,
threw in the way of the intelligent Anglo-Saxon scholar an altogether
indisputable confirmation of the general accuracy of the conclusions
he had arrived at. A comparison of the various steps in this process
of elucidation furnishes one of the most singular modern contributions
to the curiosities of literature. A few years ago a MS. volume consisting
chiefly of Anglo-Saxon homilies, was discovered at Vercelli, in
the Milanese, but which also contained, intermingled with the prose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>some Anglo-Saxon religious poems. One of these, entitled a "Dream
of the Holy Rood," extends to 310 lines, and in this are found the
whole of the fragmentary lines previously translated by Mr. Kemble,
along with the context which fills up the numerous lacunæ of the
time-worn inscription on the Ruthwell cross. No confirmation of the
accuracy of conclusions previously published could well be more gratifying
or satisfactory than this; independently of which the beauty
of the Anglo-Saxon poem suffices to convey a singularly vivid idea
of the civilisation existing at the period&mdash;probably not later than the
ninth century&mdash;when it was engraved on the venerable Scottish monument
which has anew excited the veneration of the modern descendants
of its old Anglo-Saxon builders, and, with some portion of its
former beauty renewed by the piety of modern hands, is restored to
the occupation of its ancient site. Of the high civilisation of this
period, however, the student of Anglo-Saxon history can need no new
proof when he bears in mind, as Mr. Kemble has remarked, "that
before the close of the eighth century Northumberland was more advanced
in civilisation than any other portion of Teutonic Europe."</p>

<p>The "Dream of the Holy Rood" represents the sleeping Christian
suddenly startled by the vision of the Cross, the instrument of man's
salvation, which appears in the sky attended with angels, and manifesting,
by various changes, its sympathy in the passion and the glory
of the Redeemer. At length the Cross itself addresses the sleeper,
and describes its feelings on being made the instrument of the suffering
of the Son of God. It is from this beautiful part of the poem
that the verses have been selected for inscription on the Ruthwell
cross. The following extracts, in which the fragments still legible on
the old monument are printed in italics, will help the reader to form
some idea of the refinement of the period when the cross was erected,
and may also suffice to shew how little need there is to seek in Scandinavian,
or other foreign sources, for the taste or skill manifested
in the works of early native art. The Cross thus speaks in person:&mdash;</p>

<p>This curious poem is marked by what Mr. Kemble has pronounced
to betray evidence of modern handling, and is perhaps the amplification
by a later Anglo-Saxon poet,&mdash;it may be of the simpler address
originally graven on the Ruthwell cross. Of the general identity
between the poem and the inscription, however, not the slightest
doubt can exist; and we therefore no longer depend on any future
discovery for supplying the deficiencies of the Runic legend, though
we can only guess as to the full extent to which it was carried in its
original form. "It always seemed probable," says Mr. Kemble in
concluding his observations on the old Scottish monument, "that
much of the inscription was missing, and the comparison instituted
above renders this certain. The passages which remain are too fragmentary
ever to have constituted a substantive whole, without very
considerable additions, which there is no longer room for upon the
cross in its present form. Buried perhaps beneath the soil of the
churchyard, or worked into the walls of neighbouring habitations, the
supplementary fragments may yet be reserved for a late resurrection.
Should they ever again meet the eyes of men they will add little to
our knowledge; still we should rejoice to find them once again resuming
their old place in the pillar, and helping to reconstruct in its
original form the most beautiful as well as the most interesting relic
of Teutonic antiquity."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be vain to speculate now on the probability of the former
existence of such monuments in other localities, when it is considered
that in the great majority of cases scarcely a relic remains even of
the ancient parish churches of Scotland, built after the final establishment
of a Saxon population in the low country. One other Runic
monument, however, is known to have existed in the same district
down to a very, recent period. Mr. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharp of
Hoddam, informs me that in the ancient church of Hoddam, a sculptured
stone, which was built into the wall, bore an inscription of some
length, in Runic characters. Of this he made a copy before the final
demolition of the ruined church in 1815, but he has since sought for
the transcript in vain. The original, it is to be feared, no longer
exists; but among various sculptured fragments rescued from the
ruins, and now in Mr. Sharp's collection, are portions of the shaft of a
cross, divided into compartments with sculptured figures in relief, bearing
a very considerable resemblance to the style of decoration on the
Ruthwell cross, with the addition in one compartment of the favourite
interlaced knotwork of Scottish and Irish sculptors. That the venerable
ecclesiastical edifice included in its masonry relics of still earlier date,
has already been shewn by the rescue of a Roman altar from its ruined
walls, dedicated by a cohort of German auxiliaries to imperial Jove.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Other remarkable Anglo-Saxon memorials have been discovered
within the ancient kingdom of Northumbria, as well as beyond its
southern limits. One of the most interesting of these is a square
font, at Bridekirk, in Cumberland. It is covered on each of its four
sides with singular sculptures, in some of which a resemblance may
be traced to the decorations of the Scottish standing stones. On the
east side a curious group represents the baptism of our Saviour, who
stands in a square font with a nimbus encircling his head, and over
him is the dove perched on a tree. On the south side is a Runic
inscription interwoven among ornaments, which still remains to be
satisfactorily explained.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Mr. Rolfe of Sandwick has in his possession

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>interest, now that English archæologists have learned that it is to
themselves and not to Scandinavian scholars that they must look for
the elucidation of the literature of their own Anglo-Saxon progenitors.</p>

<p>In the Orkney and Shetland Islands, which were so long occupied
as a Norse jarldom, the relics of Scandinavian art are, as might be
expected, more abundant than in any other part of the country.
The woodcut represents a bronze pin about one-fourth of the natural
size, which was found in a tumulus at Sandwick, in Orkney. Another
nearly similar to this, preserved in the local museum at Kirkwall, is
said to have been found in a cist containing a human skeleton, and
sticking in the skull, as if it had been the instrument of death.
Other examples of similar pins with rings attached to them have
been discovered at various times in the Orkney Islands. But not
only have such relics been met with singly from time to time, but
occasionally whole groups of graves have been exposed containing
Scandinavian weapons and personal ornaments, and in some cases at
least appearing to indicate the site of a battle-field in which many
of the Northern warriors have fallen. Wallace describes, in his
Account of the Islands of Orkney, the discovery of graves in the
Links of Tranaby in Westray, "in one of which was seen a man lying
with his sword on the one hand and a Danish axe on the other, and
others that have had dogs, combs, and knives buried with them."
In the spring of 1849 the shifting of the sands during the continuance
of high easterly winds brought to light a remarkable group of graves
on the Links of Pier-o-waal at Westray. A partial notice of this interesting
discovery was communicated by Mr. T. Crofton Croker to the
Journal of the Archæological Association,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> accompanied with illustrations
engraved from various of the articles found deposited with the
dead. The following details are chiefly supplied from notes by Mr.
William Rendall, surgeon, who repaired to the Links of Pier-o-waal on
learning of the discovery of the graves, and wrote down these observations
as they fell under his notice.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Though in some cases less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>ample than might be desired, they supply an exceedingly interesting
series of data in illustration of the sepulchral relics of Orkney belonging
to the latest Pagan era.</p>

<p>The following group of graves was found near the sea-shore, on
the Links of Pier-o-waal, Orkney, on a line running north and south.</p>

<p>No. 1. This grave appeared to have been previously disturbed. Sufficient
traces of the skeleton were found to indicate that the body
had lain north and south, rather inclining to the right side, with the
face towards the sea. Only half of the skull remained, and from its
appearance it might have been cleft when interred. A small iron
hatchet lay before the body. Half of a helmet was also discovered,
and small pieces of iron were scattered around, apparently indicating
that the occupant of the grave had been buried in armour.</p>

<p>No. 2 contained part of a human skeleton along with that of a horse.
The horse lay on its belly, with its head towards the sea, and directly
north-east, with its hinder parts towards the south-west. The horse's
head, which was quite entire and of rather a small size, was resting
on the nose. On removing it, an iron-bit with one of the bridle-rings
attached, was found between its jaws. The remains of the human
skeleton were lying immediately in front of the horse's head, with the
feet towards the north, and the thigh bones crossed. No skull could
be found. On the right side of the skeleton lay a buckle and a piece
of bone which had been attached to metal. A piece of iron, either
a small sword or a spear-head, and considerable remains of iron rust,
shewed that in this case also the deceased warrior had been laid to
rest accompanied with the panoply of war. Part of the skeleton of a
dog was discovered in the same grave.&mdash;No. 3 also contained portions
both of a human skeleton and of a horse. The position of the former
could not be ascertained. Beside it lay a small dagger, and other remains
of iron weapons or armour were found in fragments in the grave.
No. 4 contained a skeleton, lying north and south, on its right side,
and with the knees drawn up towards the abdomen. No remains of
armour were found.</p>

<p>This interesting group of early graves appears to have been entirely
distinct from those alluded to in Mr. T. Crofton Croker's account.
The second group, to which he refers, is described by Mr. Kendall as
having been discovered surrounding a tumulus, or mound of sand and
small stones, at a considerable distance from the sea, in a line running
north-west from the former site of graves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 1 was found on the south-west side of the mound. It contained
a large male skeleton nearly entire, lying north and south,
with the head to the north, and having large stones set round it in a
square form: doubtless the usual rude cist so generally adopted in the
Pagan sepulture of the north of Europe. After carefully removing
the sand, the skeleton was discovered lying inclined towards the left
side, with the knees drawn up, and the arms crossing over the breast.
About two inches from the top of the head was found a cup-like piece
of iron, described by Mr. Rendall as "evidently the part of a helmet."
Notwithstanding its position, however, it was more probably the
umbone of a shield, of which other remains were discovered in the
cist, consisting of pieces of wood, with fragments of the iron covering
still adhering to them. On the left side of the skeleton lay an iron
sword, measuring about four feet in length; a large sharpening stone,
a comb, and several glass beads, were also found in the grave.</p>

<p>No. 2. On the north side of the mound a second grave was opened,
which contained a small skeleton, lying north and south, and supposed
by Mr. Rendall to have been a female. In this and following
examples the position differed from that previously described in having
the head to the south. No fragments of iron or indications of rust
suggested the former presence of arms or armour, but on the breast
lay a pair of the large oval or shell-shaped brooches, already described;
and lower down, right over the region of the stomach, was found
another ornament of the class of trefoil-shaped clasps, described by
Mr. Worsaae, in his "Primeval Antiquities of Denmark," as occasionally
found in connexion with the oval brooches.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>&mdash;No. 3. A third
grave, opened on the north side of the mound, disclosed a small skeleton
lying between two rows of stones. This appears to have been
the grave most minutely described and illustrated in Mr. T. Crofton
Croker's communication to the Journal of the Archæological Society.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span></p>

<p>It also contained a pair of the large oval brooches, one of which is
here figured one-fourth the original size. Two long combs, decorated
on each side with ornamental carvings, were found, one of them above
each shoulder. The teeth of the combs were fastened between two
plates of bone, rivetted together with copper nails. A small bronze
pin or bodkin was likewise picked up among the interesting contents
of this cist. In this case also the skeleton is believed by Mr. Rendall
to have been that of a female: an opinion which coincides with the
conclusions arrived at by Mr. Worsaae,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> though the very large size of
the brooches seems more suited for the personal decorations of the
chieftain or the priest.</p>

</div>

<p>No. 4 was another cist on the north side of the mound, but it had
been previously disturbed, and contained only portions of a human
skeleton.&mdash;No. 5 was opened on the north-east side of the mound. It
inclosed part of a small skeleton, which Mr. Rendall pronounces to be
"evidently that of a female." This also contained a pair of oval
brooches, an ornamental pin or bodkin, and a pair of combs. The
woodcut represents one of the combs, which was presented to Mr.
Croker. It is much to be regretted that the valuable series of Scoto-Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
relics, thus brought to light by the disturbance of this
tumular cemetery, have already been dispersed in many private hands,
so as to be irrecoverably lost. Their value would have been greatly
augmented as the illustrations of an important period in our national
history, could the entire collection have been kept together, and deposited

<p>One of the bronze pins found in the above graves is figured in the
Journal of the Archæological Association. Like others previously
noticed it has a ring at the head, though it is otherwise much ruder
than the example found at Sandwick. It is engraved here about two-thirds
of the size of the original, which was thickly
encrusted with verd antique when discovered. It is
described in the notes furnished to Mr. Croker as "a
sharp-pointed metal instrument, hardly a span in
length, having a circular ring of the same metal for a
head. It was found lying on the abdomen. This
was the skeleton of an aged person, of the ordinary
size. It was nearly entire. This grave was both
covered and surrounded by large flat stones."</p>

<p>Such are some of the traces of Scandinavian influence
which the Scottish archæologist meets with in
the course of his researches. They all belong to a
comparatively recent period; and of the beautiful
class of personal ornaments, the oval brooches, which are so frequently
found, Mr. Worsaae remarks, "that they are positively to be referred
to the last period of Paganism we know with complete certainty, because
they are frequently found in graves in Iceland, which country
was first peopled by Pagan Norwegians at the close of the ninth
century." Long before that date, however, Christianity had reached
the Scottish shores; and though impeded, and even frequently eradicated
from districts where it had taken deep root, chiefly by the
malign influence of these Pagan Northmen, we have no reason to
think it was ever entirely extinct. Hence we are abundantly justified
in claiming a native origin for the Pagan arts of Scotland, and
in referring all Scandinavian influence to a late period and a very
limited locality.</p>

<p>One other singular class of Northern relics of which analogous types
have been found in Scotland, remains to be noticed. These consist of a
curious variety of vessels, presumed to have been designed for holding
liquors, but invariably made in the form of some animal or monstrous
hybrid. They differ entirely from any class of antiquities hitherto
noticed, and more nearly
resemble ancient Indian
bronzes than any of the relics
of early Northern art. The
annexed figure represents one
of these, in the collection of
Charles Kirkpatrick Sharp,
Esq., and found by him among
a hoard of long-forgotten family
heirlooms, in a vault of
his paternal mansion of Hoddam
Castle, Dumfriesshire.
Of its previous history nothing is known. It is made of bronze. The
principal figure is a lion, without a tail, measuring fourteen inches in
length, and nearly fourteen inches in greatest height. On the back
is perched a nondescript animal, half greyhound, half fish, apparently
intended for a handle to the whole, while from the breast projects a
stag's head with large antlers. This has a perforation in the back of
the neck, as if for the insertion of a stop-cock, and it appears probable
was designed for running off the liquid contained within the singular
vessel to which it is attached. A small square lid on the top of the
lion's head, opening with a hinge, supplies the requisite aperture for
filling it with whatever liquor it was designed to hold. A similar relic,
possessed by Sir John Maxwell, Bart., was dug up a few years since
on the Pollock estate, and another in the collection of the late E. W.
A. Drummond Hay, Esq., was also in the form of a lion. The conclusion
which the appearance of the whole of these relics would suggest
to an observer unfamiliar with Northern antiquities, would certainly
be that they were the products of ancient Indian rather than of Scandinavian
art. The following account, however, derived from Kluver's
Norwegian Antiquities,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> will shew that they are well known not only
in Norway and Denmark, but even in Iceland&mdash;that interesting Northern
stronghold of the later relics of Scandinavian art.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the farm of Vaaden, about five miles south-west from Drontheim, there
was found some years ago in a field, and at no great distance from the surface, an
animal form with beak and wings. In its beak it carries a man wearing a kirtle
and closed helmet, booted and spurred. The figure, which is of brass composition,
weighs five and one-half pounds. It is hollow internally. There is an aperture
on the neck of the animal, which has been provided with a lid, and another aperture
in the back of the helmet worn by the mailed figure which it carries in its
beak. Another animal figure has been preserved from time immemorial, at Mold&egrave;,
a small sea-port a little to the south of Drontheim. It resembles a unicorn, and
has an aperture in the neck, to which obviously a lid had been attached. From
the handle along the back, which represents a serpent, and the circumstance of the
horn in the forehead being hollow, it may reasonably be conjectured to have been
used as a liquor decanter. A third figure of a similar description, which is said
to have been found under ground at Helgeland&mdash;a province situated to the northward
of Drontheim&mdash;represents a knight mounted on a piebald horse in complete
armour, wearing a coat of ring-mail, a square helmet with vizor down, and carrying
a drawn sword in his hand. In this figure likewise there is an aperture in the
upper part of the helmet, and another in the forehead of the horse."</p></div>

<p>The whole of these singular groups are figured in Kluver's work,
and it will be seen that they closely correspond to the Scottish example
from Hoddam Castle. The costume of the knights in two of
them shews that they cannot be assigned to an earlier date than the
latter part of the thirteenth century. They are all nearly of the same
proportions, measuring about ten inches in length, and six inches in
height, exclusive of the mailed knight mounted on the horse in the
figure last described. Another curious specimen of the same class of
antiquities, in which the principal figure is a lion, has been preserved
for ages in the church of St. Olaf, at Vatnsfjord, in Iceland, and is
described by Professor Sj&ouml;borg, who conceives it to have been used
as a lamp. It is also referred to by Professor Finn Magnusen in the
following remarks on those figured by Kluver:&mdash;"These curious
liquor decanters&mdash;of which various specimens exist in Denmark and
other countries&mdash;are of a very remarkable formation. The two first
seem to bespeak an origin in the heathen mythology. Assuming that
even in the middle ages or at a later period they were used in the
rites of the Catholic Church, as in the instance of a like vessel, known
by the name of the Thorlacian, presented to the church at Vatnsfjord,
still it is by no means certain that such was their original purpose.
Many articles, such as tapestries, cups, vases, candlesticks, &amp;c., were
used as household commodities before they were diverted to ecclesiastical
purposes. In the same way these liquor decanters, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
neither bear the forms nor devices of Christian art, have probably
been originally adapted to another use." It will be readily admitted
that these relics present little appearance of having been designed as
any of the sacred vessels of the medieval church; nevertheless little
doubt can be entertained that they were so used in the north, and
perhaps at an early period throughout Christendom, as part of the
furniture of the altar. Professor Munch, who examined the example
figured above, in the collection of Mr. Sharp, during his recent visit
to this country, observes in a letter written since his return to Norway:
"Notwithstanding their fantastic shapes, of some four-footed beast,
they were used upon the altar as vessels containing the water which
the officiating Diaconus poured upon the hands of the priest before
his touching the host at the elevation. I understand from Mr. Thomsen,
who learned it from a Frenchman educated at Smyrna, that such
vessels are still used for the same purpose in the Roman Catholic
chapels in the Levant. It is therefore probable that those found in
Norway have either been brought from Byzantium, or made after
Byzantine models."</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical character of these singular relics would therefore
seem to be more certainly established than their Scandinavian origin,
though it may still be doubted whether they were primarily designed
for any sacred purpose. It is, however, sufficient for our present object
to trace the analogy discernible between the Scottish relic figured
above and those Scandinavian antiquities discovered in the native
country of the old Northmen, or preserved in their ancient seat of
colonization on the verge of the Arctic Circle. In the latter instance,
at least, we find them devoted to the uses of the church and placed
alongside of its most sacred furniture; while to all appearance they
seem to be more adapted to social purposes, which, among the northern
nations especially, are most allied to excess.</p>

<p>These objects of Northern antiquity, however, form a class by themselves,
and bear no analogy to the prevailing types of the last Pagan
period, either in the Scandinavian countries or in Britain. However
clearly the facts above referred to shew that they pertain to the antiquities
of Norway and Denmark, they cannot be assigned to the
same era of Northern art, which produced the beautiful oval brooches
and other contemporary relics. They seem rather to point to a later
period of intercourse with the East, when the Cufic coins, which are
familiar to Northern antiquaries, were introduced. The oldest of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
date as early as the year 79 of the Hegira, or <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 698, but they have
been found of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1010, and may be presumed to have reached the
north of Europe at a somewhat later period than the last of these
dates.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/image559.jpg" width="332" height="505" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Beautiful as some of the relics of Scandinavian art found in Scotland
are, they can hardly be considered equal to contemporary examples
of native workmanship, such as the very fine early Scottish
brooch found in the vicinity of the mounds of Dunipace, and figured
on a previous page. Compared with the Caithness oval brooch, selected
as the very best of its class, it will, I think, be generally acknowledged
as exhibiting both a more defined and a higher style of art. But
independently of the beauty of this native relic, nothing is more remarkable
than the striking contrast which it presents in form, and
style of ornament, to any known class of Scandinavian personal ornaments,
while, like most of the later native examples, it bears a close
affinity to the contemporary productions of Irish art. The woodcut
shews the ornamental interlaced knotwork on
the upper portion of the acus, which, in the
complete view of the brooch, is concealed by
the central ornament.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> In its imperfect state
it is sufficiently apparent that this had been
of the same disproportionate length as is frequently
found in Irish examples, otherwise
greatly varying in form. This is particularly
the case with the ring fibulæ, generally of silver.
One of these, found in county Antrim,
and engraved in the Archæological Journal,
measures above six and one-fourth inches
long,<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> while a larger and still more beautiful
one, in the Museum of Trinity College, Dublin, is nearly fourteen
inches in length. This singular feature in the brooches of the early
Christian Period both of Scotland and Ireland, most probably had its
origin in some peculiar fashion of the Celtic dress, superseded in the
former country during the vital changes which affected it in the eleventh
century. The annexed woodcut shews another beautiful Scottish
brooch, also from the collection of Mr. John Bell of Dungannon. It
is of less costly material than the Dunipace brooch, being made of
bronze, but, like it, it has been jewelled, and is otherwise little inferior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>in point of workmanship. It was found accidentally amongst old brass,
in a brazier's shop in Glasgow, and
is engraved here the full size of the
original.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/image560.jpg" width="169" height="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The brooch has always been a favourite
Celtic ornament, and is indeed
almost indispensable to the
Highland costume. It is worn universally
by the Scottish Highlanders,
both male and female; and in many
Highland families, of various ranks,
favourite brooches have been preserved
through many generations, as heirlooms
which no pecuniary inducement would tempt their
humblest owner to part with. The most celebrated
of these is the brooch of Lorn, dropt by
Robert the Bruce after the defeat of his followers
at Methven, when he was compelled to abandon
his mantle and the brooch which fastened it, to
rid himself of an assailant who held it in his dying
grasp. This interesting historic memorial is still
preserved by the lineal descendant of the Macdougals
of Lorn.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Another remarkable relic of
the same class is the Glenlyon brooch, which has
been preserved in the family of the Campbells of
Glenlyon for many generations. It is circular, and
of silver, richly jewelled. An ornamental bar, also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>jewelled, crosses the centre, and two tongues meet on this from opposite
sides. It is engraved on <i>Plate</i> II. from careful drawings made
from the original. On the lower side are the names of the three Kings
of Cologne, a favourite inscription on medieval amulets, thus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="antiqua">Caspar. Melchior. Baltazar. Consumatum.</span></p>

<p>Pennant has engraved this ancient Scottish brooch, but the figure
conveys a very partial idea of the rude magnificence of the original,
which measures five and a half inches in circumference.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>With these native personal ornaments, introduced here for the
purpose of comparison and contrast with those traceable to a Scandinavian
source, may also be noticed the silver brooches, of various
forms, which are frequently found in Scotland, and are also not unfamiliar
to English antiquaries. They are invariably inscribed with
some sacred formula or charm, the most common one being <span class="smcap">Iesus</span>
<span class="smcap">Nazarenus</span>. One example, in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
is a small octagonal fibula, without ornament, which is said to
have been discovered in excavating the tomb of King Robert the
Bruce, at Dunfermline, in 1818. It is inscribed,&mdash;<span class="antiqua">Iesus. Nazarenus
Rex. Iudeorum</span>. Another of the same form, but larger, and of superior
workmanship, recently found among the ruins of Eilan Donan
Castle, on Loch Duich, the ancient stronghold of the M'Kenzies,
bears the abbreviated inscription, <span class="antiqua">Iesus. Nazar</span>. Scottish examples
of the same class might be greatly multiplied, but the most of them
belong to a considerably later period than that to which we now refer.</p>

</div>

<p>In the earliest and rudest states of society, war and the chase become
at once the business of life, and, with the needful preparations
of weapons and other requisites, suffice to supply each day with its
full complement of labour and pastime. A very slight rise, however,
in the social scale, creates the desire for some artificial means of filling
up the leisure hours of life; and the modes adopted for this
purpose often form no uncertain criterion of the age in which they
originate. We accordingly find traces of the existence of games both
of chance and skill from a very remote period. Reference has already
been made to spherical and truncated stones, measuring from an inch
to an inch and a half in diameter, which are frequently found in
tumuli. For the former the name of Bead-stones is proposed, and
as they are generally perforated, their use as personal ornaments
has been assumed as probable, notwithstanding their cumbrous size,
and the unattractive appearance of many of them. But as they are
also very frequently flat on one side,
there is greater probability of the
original purpose of the latter class,
at least, having been for table-stones
(Anglo-Saxon, <i>tæfelstan</i>) or draughtsmen,
in which case the perforation
might serve to string them together,
for carrying about. In Ireland, and still more frequently in Norway,
draughtsmen are found alongside of the weapons and other relics
buried with the warrior. They are made generally of bone, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
conical or hemispherical shape, and with a hole in the bottom, designed,
as is presumed, to admit of their use on shipboard. With
these it is supposed the northmen beguiled the tedium of their long
voyages; and the estimation in which they are held is implied in
their deposition among the most favourite relics of the dead. We
learn from Tacitus that the Germans were so passionately addicted
to gambling, that they staked not only their property but their personal
liberty. The Romans were themselves scarcely less given to
such excesses. Among the many interesting relics restored to light
from the ruins of Pompeii, not the least valuable as illustrations of
the manners of the first century in Southern Italy, are the cogged
dice of the old Roman gamblers. But besides these games which
mingled the incentive and the excitement of chance and skill, there
appears also to have been in use, from a very early period, others of
the simpler class, still favourites among our rustic population, such
as bowling, nine-pins, and the like; which, under the various names
of skales or kayles, loggats, closh, &amp;c., are frequently mentioned in
ancient statutes, and have been found represented on manuscripts of
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The implements of such
pastimes are not such as were likely, in many cases, to be long preserved,
though it is by no means improbable that the spherical stone-balls
frequently found along with ancient relics, and even in the
tumuli, may have been used for some such purpose.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> One interesting
and well-authenticated example, however, is known of the discovery
of a complete set of the implements for such a game, in the parish of
Balmaclellan, Kirkcudbrightshire. They are thus described by the
well-known antiquary, Mr. Joseph Train: "In the summer of 1834,
as the servants of Mr. Bell of Baryown, were casting peats on Ironmacaunnie
Moor, when cutting near the bottom of the moss, they
laid open with their spades what appeared to be the instruments of
an ancient game, consisting of an oaken ball, eighteen inches in circumference,
and seven wooden pins, each thirteen inches in length, of
a conical shape, with a circular top. These ancient <i>Reel Pins</i>, as
they are termed by Strutt, were all standing erect on the hard till,
equidistant from each other, with the exception of two, which pointed
towards the ball that lay about a yard in front, from which it may be
inferred they were overthrown in the course of the game. The ball
has been formed of solid oak, and, from its decayed state, must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>remained undisturbed for centuries, till discovered at a depth of not
less than twelve feet from the original surface. At Pompeii, utensils
are often found, seemingly in the very position in which they were
last used. This may be accounted for by the suddenness of the calamity
that befell that devoted city; but what induced or impelled the
ancient gamesters, in this remote corner of the Glenkens, to leave
the instruments of their amusements in what might be considered
the middle of the game? These relics, which are in my possession,
can now only be prized for their curiosity, the singular position in
which they were found, and the relation they bear to ancient times."<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
The moss in which this remarkable discovery was made is described as
a place where peats have been cut from time immemorial. It were
vain to speculate on the origin or owners of these homely relics of
obsolete pastimes; yet to the curious fancy, indulging in the reanimation
of such long-silent scenes, they seem suggestive of the sudden
intrusion, it may be, of invaders, the hasty call to arms, the utter
desolation of the scene, and then the slow lapse of unnumbered centuries,
during which the moss accumulated above them so gently that
it seems as if the old revellers were to return and play out their unfinished
game.</p>

<p>Amusements of the latter class scarcely admit of much refinement,
and may well be supposed to have exercised fully as much ingenuity
among the ancient players of the Glenkens, as they now do in the
bowling-green or skittle-ground. From them, indeed, modern refinement
has educed the practised art of the billiard-table. In a simpler
age the improvement assumed a more practical form, and gave way
to putting the stone, throwing the hammer, and the like trials of
strength, which appear to have been favourite pastimes among the
Scottish Highlanders from the earliest periods to which their traditions
extend.</p>

<p>In complete contrast to these are the amusements indicated by the
bone draughtsmen or bead-stones of the tumuli. They are appropriately
classed by Strutt in his "Sports and Pastimes," under the
general title of "Sedentary Games;" and he furnishes much curious
information regarding medieval pastimes, of which traces may be detected
in the remoter periods into which we are inquiring. The construction
of regular draughtsmen and chessmen is in itself an evidence
of increased taste for such amusements. The ancients employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
stones, shells, or nuts as counters, and also, there is reason to think,
as tablemen, in games of this nature. Hence the Greek name &#968;&#951;&#966;&#959;&#953;,
and the Roman <i>calculi</i> and <i>scrupuli</i>; from whence <i>scrupus</i>, a table-man,
or chessman. The Scandinavian terms are of similar import;
and among the ancient Northern games which have survived as popular
pastimes in Iceland and Lapland, we find the very same which figure
among the illuminations of medieval manuscripts, and have influenced
the grotesque decorations of our early ecclesiastical architecture. "Of
such games," says a writer in the Report of the Royal Society of
Northern Antiquaries, "we find that our Pagan ancestors were acquainted
with at least three different sorts, namely, <i>hnefatafl</i>, fist-play,
<i>i.e.</i>, hand-play;<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> <i>hnottafl</i>, nut-play; and <i>sk&aacute;ktafl</i>, chess. <i>Hnottafl</i>
signifies properly a game played with nuts, or pieces shaped like
nuts. A <i>h&uacute;ni</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a bear, or bear's cub&mdash;was anciently the principal
personage in it; but in Iceland, where the fox is the only beast of
prey, this animal eventually superseded the bear, and the game then
came to be denominated <i>refsk&aacute;l</i>. The other pieces represented sheep,
or lambs, pursued by Reynard. In the variety of this game, which
still forms one of the favourite diversions of the Laplanders, the fox
continues to play his part, with this difference, that he there pursues
geese instead of lambs; as in the <i>G&auml;nsespiel</i> of the Germans, the <i>Fox</i>
<i>and geese</i> of the English, the <i>Ganzespeel</i> of the Dutch, the <i>Jeu d'oie</i> of
the French, &amp;c. In Denmark a dog usually takes the place of the
fox, and hares of the geese; and hence the game is there called <i>Hund</i>
<i>og hare</i>, or hound and hare." According to the Irish chroniclers,
Cahir Mor, who died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 177, left, among other legacies to his son,
both chessboards (<i>fichell</i>) and chessmen (<i>muintir</i>;) and the Welsh
laws of Howel Dha, (<i>circa</i> <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 943,) refer to some species of game
played with pieces of different colours, (<i>werin</i>,) on a table-board,
(<i>tawlbwrdd</i>.) In Bishop Percy's "Translation of Runic Poetry," a
Northern hero says,&mdash;"I am master of nine accomplishments. I play
at chess; I know how to engrave Runic characters," &amp;c.; and in a
curious Anglo-Saxon poem, translated for the first time into English
by Mr. J. M. Kemble in his paper on Anglo-Saxon Runes, this
stanza occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chessman is ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Play and laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the proud, where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the beer-hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blithe together.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not necessary to assume that all, or indeed any of these allusions
necessarily apply to the game of chess, but only to one of the
old table-games, played with pieces, many of which will more readily
account for the "play and laughter" in the warrior's hall than that
skilful and complicated game. These, as well as so many other of the
primitive arts and rites of the North, were in all probability brought
with the earlier nomades from the eastern cradle-land of our race; for
more than one representation of such table-games has been discovered
among the pictorial decorations of the Egyptian temples. Dr. Brunton
has figured two of these at Medinat Haboo, in his <i>Excerpta Hieroglyphica</i>,
in one of which (<i>Plate</i> XIII.) the table and pieces are partly
obliterated, but in the other (<i>Plate</i> XI.) it is observable that the pieces
are all alike, resembling the most common modern form of chess-pawns.
The players are also in both cases moving their pieces at the
same time; so that the Egyptian game evidently bore very slight resemblance
to chess, and may with more probability be sought for
among the early table-games of the north of Europe.</p>

<p>The great antiquity of the game of chess has been long since established
on indisputable evidence. For its invention and earliest form
the best authorities agree in looking to India, whither the simpler
table-games of Egypt may have passed before the migration of the
Teutonic races from Asia, and been returned from thence to Europe
in their later and more complicated forms. In the ninth century,
while yet the Northmen were only known along the British coasts as
the dreaded marauding Vikings, Ragnar Lodbrog is reputed to have
visited the Hellespont, and the intercourse between the Scandinavians
and the Greeks of the Lower Empire, is an accredited feature of well
authenticated history. But pilgrimages to Rome, and the passing
and repassing of the clergy from Britain to the Continent, were
matters of common occurrence at an earlier date; so that there can
be no difficulty as to the means by which the game might be introduced
from Asia to the north of Europe. Into this curious question
Sir Frederick Madden has entered with great learning and ability,
collecting the numerous observations of previous writers, and illustrat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>ing
them from his own copious stores.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> It will suffice for our present
purpose to notice the remarkable illustrations of the implements of
this game which have been discovered in Scotland, surpassing in
number and value any specimens of ancient chessmen known to exist,
if we except the set still preserved in the Cabinet of Antiquities in
the Biblioth&egrave;que du Roi at Paris, and which there is satisfactory
evidence for believing may be the very chessmen presented to Charlemagne
by the Empress Irene, or her successor Nicephorus.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1831, the inroads effected by the sea undermined
and carried away a considerable portion of a sandbank in the parish of
Uig, Isle of Lewis, and uncovered a small subterranean stone building
like an oven, at some depth below the surface. The exposure of this
singular structure having excited the curiosity, or more probably the
cupidity, of a peasant who chanced to be working in the neighbourhood,
he proceeded to break into it, when he was astonished to see
what he concluded to be an assemblage of elves or gnomes upon whose
mysteries he had unconsciously intruded. The superstitious Highlander
flung down his spade, and fled home in dismay; but incited by
the bolder curiosity of his wife he was at length induced to return to
the spot, and bring away with him the singular little ivory figures,
which had not unnaturally appeared to him the pigmy sprites of Celtic
folk-lore. They consisted in all of at least ninety-two pieces, including
fourteen tablemen or draughtsmen, eight of which are kings, eight
queens, thirteen bishops, fifteen knights, and twelve figures of footmen,
to which Sir Frederick Madden gives the name of warders.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
These have been so carefully and minutely illustrated in the valuable
remarks in the Archæologia, that a slight description will now suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p>They form altogether portions of eight or more sets, none of which,
however, appear to be complete. They vary considerably in size, the
largest being four and one-eighth inches in height, while the
smallest measures fully an inch less; but the smaller sets are, upon
the whole, more carefully and elaborately carved. The annexed illustration
represents one of the smaller
kings, now in the collection of Mr.
Sharp. In point of costume it closely
resembles the example engraved in the
Archæologia, as well as the others of
the set, though differing somewhat in
the fashion of the beard. The king is
represented as an old bearded man,
with long hair falling in plaits over his
shoulders, and a low trefoil crown on his
head. He is seated on a chair with a
high back, richly carved with intricate
tracery and ornaments, corresponding,
for the most part, to the style of decoration
with which we are familiar on the Romanesque work of the
twelfth century, and holds a short sword with both hands across his
knees, as if in the act of drawing it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/image568a.jpg" width="384" height="576" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The queens are crowned and throned
in like manner. They are represented
seated in a contemplative posture, resting
the head upon the hand; and two
of them hold drinking horns in their
left hands. The most striking portion
of their costume, represented in the accompanying
engraving from one of those
in Mr. Sharp's collection, is a species of
hood depending from the back of the
head, and spreading over the shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/image568b.jpg" width="388" height="591" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Of the bishops some are seated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
chairs similar to those occupied by the kings and queens, while others
are in a standing posture. Sir F. Madden remarks, "all of the sitting
figures and four of the standing ones wear the chasuble, dalmatic,
stole, and tunic of the form anciently prescribed, and corresponding
with representations of much greater antiquity. The remainder have
a cope instead of a chasuble, but omit the stole and dalmatic. The
mitres are very low, and in some instances quite plain, but have the
double band or <i>infulæ</i> attached behind. The hair is cut short round
the head. They hold a crosier with one or with both hands; and
in the former instances, the other hand holds a book or is raised in
the attitude of benediction."</p>

<p>The knights afford perhaps the most characteristic examples of the
costume of the period. They are mounted on horseback, armed with
a heavy spear, and a long kite-shaped shield. Beneath the shield appears
the sword, attached to the waist by a belt. The helmets are
mostly of a conical shape, in addition to which several have nasals projecting
in front, and round flaps protecting the ears and neck. The
horses are caparisoned in high saddles, stirrups, and bridles, and with
long saddlecloths, fringed with ornamental borders, reaching to the
ground.</p>

<p>The footmen or warders bear the same kite-shaped shields as the
horsemen, and are armed with swords and head-pieces of iron of different
forms. The costume otherwise worn by them has obviously
been made subservient to the convenience of the carver, as in the
long saddlecloths of the horsemen, and consists, for the most part, of
an ample flowing robe, reaching to the ground and concealing the
feet. Numerous variations occur in the details of these remarkable
carvings, and the utmost variety of design characterizes the ornamentation
of the chairs on which the kings, queens, and bishops are seated.
Their dresses also vary in ornamental detail, and each of the shields,
both of the knights and warders, is decorated with some peculiar device
or interlaced pattern, some of which approach very nearly to the
heraldic blazonry of a later period, and no doubt indicate the first accidental
rudiments of medieval cognizances.</p>

<p>The various details of costume and ornament indicated in this brief
description, furnish the chief evidence by which we may hope to assign
the period and place of manufacture of these interesting works
of early art. This question has already been discussed with much
learning and ability by Sir Frederick Madden, who remarks, "I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
now proceed to develop the result of my inquiries in respect to the
place where and the period when these chessmen were in all probability
manufactured. I shall draw my inferences from three separate
subjects of consideration; the material of which they are made, the
costume in which they appear, and the historical passages to be found
in the ancient writings of Scandinavia; and from each I shall endeavour
to prove that these pieces were executed about the middle of the
twelfth century, by the same extraordinary race of people who, at an
earlier period of time, under the general name of <i>Northmen</i>, overran
the greater part of Europe." Against the conclusions carefully arrived
at by following out this proposed course of reasoning, with the exception
of the period to which they are assigned, I venture, in all deference,
to enter a demurrer. It has been so long the fashion to assign
every indication of early art and civilisation found in Scotland to these
Scandinavian invaders,&mdash;though, as I trust has already been shewn,
in many cases without evidence and upon false premises,&mdash;that it becomes
the Scottish archæologist to receive such conclusions with caution,
even when advanced by high authorities and supported by evidence.
The farther we pursue this investigation into the history of
primitive native art we find the less reason to assign to it a foreign
origin, or to adopt the improbable theory that the rude Scandinavian
rovers brought with them from the Pagan North new elements of
civilisation and refinement to replace the Christian arts which they
eradicated at the point of the sword. Singer justly remarks on the
characteristic difference between the Greek and Scandinavian traditions
of the mythic artist, Dædalus or Weland, that the Greeks ascribed
to theirs: "Plastic works, and above all images of the gods,
while the Scandinavians attributed to their workman principally weapons
of a superior temper. It is that the Greeks were a people alive
to the beauty of mythologic representations. The Scandinavians, on
the contrary, valued nothing but good swords, with which they conquered
that which the rude climate of the North denied them."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
Doubtless, by the middle of the twelfth century a very great change
had taken place, but then we trace it not in the invention of a northern
Christian art, but in the tardy adoption of what was already common
to the ecclesiology and arts of Christendom.</p>

<p>As to the material of the Lewis chessmen, the mere fact of their
being made of the tusks of the <i>Rostungr</i> or Walrus&mdash;the "huel-bone"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
of Chaucer&mdash;can no more prove their Scandinavian origin, than that
of the still older set of Charlemagne being of ivory<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> (presuming this
to mean the elephant's tusk) affords any evidence of Indian manufacture.
By the middle of the twelfth century, the Northmen had
traded as well as warred with Scotland for nearly three centuries, and
were at that late period, as Mr. Worsaae remarks, "the central point
for an extensive commerce between the east and the northern parts
of Europe."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> The author of the <i>Kongs-Skugg-sio</i>, or Speculum Regale,
composed, as Einersen concludes, between the years 1154-1164, but
certainly before the close of the century, takes particular notice of
the Rostungr, and mentions also the circumstance of its teeth and
hide being used as articles of commerce. Such indeed almost of necessity
follows from the evidence of the frequent voyages of the Scandinavians
in pursuit of these animals, at a time when they had abandoned
the old predatory habits of the Vikings for a regular government
and peaceful intercourse with other nations. The nature of their
settlements on the Scottish islands and mainland, and their alliances
and intermarriage with the aboriginal race, may also suffice, if further
proof be needed, to shew that the walrus ivory could be no great
rarity in Scotland, when it formed a special article of commerce with
the Northmen. We accordingly find distinct evidence of its native
use: "Ivory dirk-hilts, elegantly turned or wrought by the hand,
were manufactured in various parts of the Highlands and isles. Of
these specimens still remain at Fingask and Glengary,"<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> and a curious
large sword, evidently of early date, preserved at Hawthornden, near
Edinburgh, has the hilt made of the narwhal's tusk. The argument
of Scandinavian origin from the material is therefore of no value, and
the varied devices on the chairs and other highly decorated portions
of the Lewis chessmen are equally little indicative of Northern art.
They are the same details as are familiar to us on the Romanesque
work of the twelfth century, never yet traced to a Northern source.
In St. Magnus Cathedral we have a most valuable specimen of Romanesque
style, executed in obedience to the piety of a Scandinavian jarl
of the Scottish Isles, but so far from finding in it any trace of a style
peculiar to the Northmen, its oldest portions are characterized by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>usual features of the fully developed style, manifestly derived from
Southern models, and betraying in these the later date of its foundation
than the examples of the same class which still remain at
Durham and Dunfermline. No Scandinavian ecclesiologist, I believe,
doubts the foreign origin of the few examples of the earlier styles of
medieval ecclesiastical architecture still remaining in Norway and
Sweden; and the evidence already adduced tends to suggest the conclusion
that whatever military and naval skill the natives of Scotland
might acquire from their intercourse with the Northmen, they were
much more likely to impart than to receive a superior knowledge in
the arts of the sculptor and the carver. Christianity was introduced
into Scotland and Ireland some centuries before its acceptance by the
Scandinavians, yet the primitive Christian monuments of Denmark
or Norway will, as works of art, bear no comparison with those which
preceded them in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/image573.jpg" width="323" height="545" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To the costume of the twelfth century we must therefore look for
the only safe guide to the origin of the Lewis chessmen. Those of
the kings and queens are of little value for this purpose, and those of
the bishops, though minutest of all, of none. It is to the military
costume of which the knights and footmen afford such curious examples
that we must have recourse for some solution of the question.
But these also are mostly of Southern and not of Scandinavian origin.
Both the shield and the pointed helmet are what would usually be
styled Norman. We find the kite-shaped shield represented in the
Bayeux tapestry; a curious example of it is engraved on a candlestick
of the twelfth century, now in the collection at Goodrich Court;<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>
and a still more conclusive instance is the remarkable group of warriors,
each with nasal, spear, and kite-shaped shield, sculptured on
the lintel of the doorway of Fordington Church, Dorchester, <i>circa</i>
1160.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Sir S. R. Meyrick conjectures that the Normans derived
this shield from Sicily. There is, at any rate, good evidence for
believing that while it was in use in Britain early in the twelfth
century, the Northmen retained their round shield till a later period.
Judging from Mr. Worsaae's valuable treatise, as well as from the
"Guide to Northern Antiquities," the round shield appears to be
alone known among the defensive arms of the latest Pagan period,
which closes little more than a century prior to the probable date
of the Lewis chessmen. But Sir F. Madden has referred to an
authority the bearing of which on this point has escaped him,
although it seems conclusive. The passage is that in Giraldus,
(quoted from a MS. temp. John,) in which he describes the descent
of the Norwegians under Hasculph or Asgal, to attack the city of
Dublin, then defended by Miles de Cogan, about the year 1172, as
follows: "A navibus igitur certatim erumpentibus, duce Johanne ...
viri bellicosi Danico more undique ferro vestiti, alii loricis longis, alii
laminis ferreis arte consutis, <i>clipeis quoque rotundis et rubris</i>, circulariter
ferro munitis, homines tam animis ferrei quam armis, ordinatis
turmis, ad portam orientalem muros invadunt." Such shields, formed
of wood bound with iron, and with an iron umbo in the centre, are
still preserved in Norway, and correspond not only to the requisitions
of the old Gulathings-law, cap. 309, circa 1180, but even to a later
one&mdash;circa 1270. Into the minuter details of <i>wambeys</i>, <i>gambeson</i>,
<i>panzar</i>, &amp;c., referred to in the Archæologia, it is needless to enter,
because most of them are wanting on the chessmen, or can at best
only be guessed at. Were the swords and shields removed from the
warders, along with their beards, so little would any one dream of
detecting such traces of medieval
armour in their costume, that even
their sex might be in doubt, and
some of their conical helmets and
gambesons might serve equally well
for the scapulars and tunics of gentle
nuns.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Of the horsemen also little
positive can be made out of anything
but the helmet and shield; and of
the former scarcely two are alike on
knights or warders, the difference in
some of them amounting to a total
dissimilarity in form and fashion.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature
in the knight-pieces is the small size
of the horses, so characteristic of the old Scottish breed. But it is
even matter of doubt if the Norse warriors of the twelfth century ever
fought on horseback. If they did so at that period, it was a novelty
borrowed, like their new faith and arts, from the nations of the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>A figure of a mounted warrior, apparently bearing a close resemblance
to the chess knights, with a peaked helmet, carrying a spear, and
with a long saddle cloth pendant from his horse, is sculptured in relief,
amid knotwork and floriated ornaments, on an early monumental
slab in the Relig Oran at Iona. A claymore of antique form occupies
the centre of the slab, but the shield is concealed by the position of
the figure. It is not, however, to the sculptured monuments either
of Scotland or of Norway and Denmark that we must look for identifying
the costume of these figures with any contemporary examples.
Fortunately the same class of evidence has been preserved, on perhaps
still more trustworthy authority, not in marble but in wax, in the
royal and baronial seals attached to early charters. From these we
learn that prior to the date of the Norwegians assailing Miles de
Cogan, armed with their "shields, round and red," both the peaked
helmet and nasal, and the kite-shaped shield, were the usual defensive
armour of the Scottish baron. On the seal, for example, appended
to the charter of Robert de Lundres, c. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1165, conveying a carucate
of land in Roxburghshire to the Abbey of Melros, the knight is
represented on horseback in full armour, with a flattened helmet with
nasal and a kite-shaped shield.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> So also in the seals of Uchtred, son
of Osulf: William son of John: Philip de Valoniis, chamberlain of
Scotland, c. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1176; and on that of Richard de Morville, constable
of Scotland, appended to a charter <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1176: all among the charters
of the Abbey of Melros, about the middle of the twelfth century, we
find the kite-shaped shield, the nasal, and the peaked helmet; while
in the very beautiful seal of Patrick de Dunbar, c. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1200, the
nasal appears attached to a round chapel-de-fer, very similar to
those worn by some of the Lewis warders.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Such examples might be
greatly multiplied, but these are sufficient to shew the entire correspondence
of the chessmen found in Lewis, both with the contemporary
native costume and with other productions of Scottish art of the
twelfth century, while it still remains to be shewn that such resemblance
is traceable in any single undoubted Scandinavian work of the
same period. The intimate intercourse between the Scandinavian and
native races of the north of Scotland, and their offensive and defensive
alliances already referred to, would indeed render it probable that in
the twelfth century no great difference existed in their weapons or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>defensive armour. Yet we find no traces in the arms or armour
of the Scottish Highlanders, with whom alone such close alliances
were formed, of anything resembling those in question. In the
Lothians, or Saxonia, as it is sometimes styled even in the Pictish
Chronicle, it was entirely different. Before the close of the eleventh
century, a mingled Saxon and Norman population occupied the old
kingdom of Northumbria, a Saxon queen shared the Scottish throne,
and exercised a most important influence in changing the manners
of the people, and in modifying and reforming their ecclesiastical
system. To this period, therefore, and from this source it is that we
must look for the introduction of the military costume of the South,
as well as of the minutiæ of clerical attire, which may be presumed
to have previously been as little in conformity with the Roman model
as the other parts of the system.</p>

<p>Founding on the supposed discovery of the Lewis chessmen within
tide-mark, and exposed to the sea on the shores of Lewis, it has been
suggested that they "formed part of the stock of an Icelandic <i>kaup-mann</i>
or merchant, who carried these articles to the Hebrides or
Ireland for the sake of traffic; and the ship in which they were conveyed
being wrecked, these figures were swept by the waves on shore,
and buried beneath the sandbank."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> This supposition, however,
was formed under imperfect information of the circumstances attending
the discovery, as they were found in a stone building, which,
from the general description furnished of it, there appears reason to
assume, must have been a Scottish Weem, and in the vicinity of a
considerable ruin. There is greater probability in the earlier conjecture,
that the carving of these ancient chessmen may have helped to
relieve the monotony of cloistral seclusion. The minuteness of detail
in the ecclesiastical costume is much more explicable on such a supposition
than by a theory which would ascribe either to an Icelandic
<i>kaup-mann</i>, or Norse carver of the twelfth century, such a knowledge
of Episcopal chasuble, dalmatic, stole, cope, and tunic, as is traceable
in the bishops of the Lewis chessmen.</p>

</div>

<p>Danish antiquaries have naturally been little inclined to dispute
the idea of a Scandinavian origin assigned on such high authority to
the beautiful specimens of carved chessmen found in Scotland. A
keen spirit of nationality has been enlisted with the happiest effects
in the cause of Northern Archæology, and however honestly bent on
the discovery of truth, it was scarcely to be looked for that the Danish
archæologist should search too curiously into the evidence by which such
valuable relics were handed over to him. They are, accordingly, referred
to in the Report of the Northern Antiquaries for 1836, under the
title of Scandinavian Chessmen, and at length figure in the "Guide
to Northern Archæology," among articles from the Christian Period,
without its even being hinted that they were discovered, not in Denmark
but in Scotland. The subject is treated more at large in the
interesting paper on "Some Ancient Scandinavian Chessmen," included
in the Report of the Northern Antiquaries to its British and
American Members, in which several specimens found in Scandinavia
are described and engraved. One of these, a female figure on horseback,
supposed to be a queen-piece, (also figured in the Guide to
Northern Archæology, p. 75,) is in the private collection of Professor
Sj&ouml;borg. On it the writer remarks,&mdash;"The serpentine ornament upon
it resembles, it will be observed, those on several of the chessmen
found at Lewis. The mantle, too, or veil, hanging down the shoulders
of the figure, is another point of similitude between them." A
comparison of the engraving in Lord Ellesmere's translation of the
Guide to Northern Archæology, with the Lewis chessmen in the
British Museum, will suffice to shew
how easily men are persuaded of what
they wish to believe. The character
both of horse and rider essentially differ;
the costumes in no way resemble
each other more than all female dresses
necessarily do; while the horses differ
as much as is well possible. In the
Lewis knights their horses' manes are
cut short and stand up, while the hair
hangs down over their foreheads. In
the Scandinavian example the mane is
long, and the forehead uncovered; and
what is no less worthy of note, the
horse, both in this and the following
examples, differs from the former in being of full size, as tested by
the comparative proportions of the rider. The horse-furniture is
equally dissimilar: but a still greater and more important disagreement
is in the style of art. A very great resemblance may be traced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
between the square forms and most characteristic details of the
Lewis horses' heads, and the contemporary sculptures of Dalmeny
Church, Linlithgowshire, where a series of similar heads occur in the
corbel-table of the Apse. Such a comparison affords the best test of
style, the peculiarities of which are more easily illustrated than described.
No such resemblance could possibly be suggested by Professor
Sj&ouml;borg's chesspiece; and the similarity which the Danish
antiquaries discover in its serpentine ornament to those of the Lewis
carvings, is little more satisfactory. The difference in style is no
less obvious in two carved groups from the Christiansborg Collection
at Copenhagen, (tab. vi. figs. 1, 2,) representing, the one a king
and the other a queen on horseback, and surrounded each by four
attendants. They are also formed of the tooth of the <i>Rostungr</i> or
walrus, and are believed to be the king and queen pieces of a set of
chessmen. It is sufficient to say of them that they bear equally little
resemblance to the Lewis figures in arms, armour, costume, or ornamental
details. In Scotland it is otherwise. Examples have been
found there admitting of comparison with the Lewis chessmen.
Pennant engraves one discovered in the ruins of Dunstaffnage Castle,
Argyleshire, the ancient royal abode of the Dalriadic kings. It represents
a king seated in a chair of square form, holding a book in
the left hand. The costume differs from the kings of the Lewis sets,
and obviously belongs to a somewhat later period; but the general
arrangement of the figures correspond, and there can be no doubt
that the latter is the king-piece of a similar set of chessmen. It is
still preserved at Dunstaffnage, where it was examined by Pennant
in 1772.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>Another of the chesspieces referred to is in the Museum of the
Scottish Antiquaries, and furnishes a most beautiful example of the
skill of the early carvers. It is also wrought from the walrus ivory,
and may be presumed to have formed a warder or rook-piece of the
set. It represents two mailed knights, armed with sword and shield,
and may be ascribed to the early part of the thirteenth century.
The shields are shorter than in the Lewis figures, and the devices
afford an interesting means of comparison. Several of the ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
patterns wrought on the shields of the former bear such close resemblance
to heraldic distinctions that they admit of intelligible description
according to rules of blazonry, yet they are all evidently mere
arbitrary ornaments and not bearings; whereas on one of the shields
of the latter knight we have a curious and very early example of
<i>dimidiation</i> in heraldry,&mdash;a <i>fleur-de-lys</i> dimidiated on a diapered
field,&mdash;a figure little likely to be chosen for mere ornament. The
history of this interesting relic is unknown. It was presented to the
Society by Lord Macdonald in 1782, as <i>the handle of a Highland</i>
<i>dirk</i>. From his extensive possessions in the Isle of Skye, it is not
improbable that it may have been found there, where the frequent
discovery of relics of different periods attests the ancient presence of
a population skilled in the useful and ornamental arts. It measures
three and five-eighth inches in height, and is fully equal, in point
of workmanship, to any of the Lewis figures, though certainly exhibiting
no characteristics which should suggest any doubt of its
native workmanship.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Chesspiece, Scottish Antiquarian Museum.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The annexed woodcut exhibits another chesspiece, apparently of a
still later date, preserved in the collection formed by Sir John Clerk
at Penicuick House. Attached to it is a parchment label in the
handwriting of the old Scottish Antiquary, which thus describes it:
"An ancient piece of sculpture on the tooth of a whale. It was
found by Jo. Adair, geographer, in the north of Scotland, anno 1682.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
All the figures are remarkable." John Adair, geographer for Scotland,
was appointed by the Lords of the Scottish Privy-Council, in
1682, to make a survey of the whole kingdom, and maps of the different
shires. This he effected, and published the first part of his
work, but, unfortunately, obstacles arising apparently from the tardy
advances of the necessary funds, prevented the second part&mdash;including
his voyage round the Western Isles and an account of the Roman
wall&mdash;from ever appearing, and his papers, it is to be feared, no longer
exist.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> It was, no doubt, while he was engaged on this survey, that
the interesting relic was discovered which is figured here. It has
evidently formed a queen-piece, though consisting in all of seven
figures. The queen is
represented crowned,
and seated on her
throne, with a lap-dog
on her knee, and apparently
a book in her
right hand. On her
left is a knight in full
armour, with drawn
sword, and from whose
costume we can have
little hesitation in assigning
the work to
the early part of the
fourteenth century. On
the right hand of the
throne stands a trouvere
or minstrel playing on the crowde, an ancient musical instrument
somewhat resembling the violin. Behind are four female figures,
holding each other by the hand, and the one next to the minstrel
bearing a palm-branch. This curious chesspiece is of great value;
as adding another link to the chain of chronological evidence by
which we trace the continuous native production of these costly relics
of ancient pastime in our own country.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Queen-piece, Penicuick House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Albert Way has described two other very curious chessmen,
both knight-pieces. One of these, which is preserved in the Ashmolean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
Museum, is also believed to be made of the walrus tooth, and is
interesting as an example of military costume, apparently belonging
to the early part of the reign of Henry III. The other figure is carved
in ivory, and furnishes a very minute and characteristic illustration
of the military costume and horse-armour in use during the reign of
Edward III.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> But a much more remarkable relic of the same class,
believed to be a queen-piece, is figured and described in the Archæological
Journal.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> It was found, about twenty years since, in the ruins
of Kirkstall Abbey, and is said to bear some resemblance to another
of inferior workmanship, discovered along with several chesspieces
at Woodperry, Oxfordshire. One of these, a bishop, is also engraved
in the Archæological Journal.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The form of the Kirkstall piece is
further illustrated by the illuminations of a German MS. of the fourteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> where Otho, Marquis of Brandenbourg, who died in
1298, is represented playing at chess with a lady, and with such a
piece before him on the board. The details of this queen-piece are
very peculiar. The four-leaved flower and triangular foliation would
suggest a date not earlier than the close of the thirteenth century;
nor is there anything irreconcilable with this in the very singular
figures which they accompany. A parallel may be found to the most
remarkable of them in the sculptural details which the exuberant
fancy of that period lavished on cathedrals and shrines, without, we
may suspect, always troubling themselves for the meanings which
modern symbolists insist on deducing from them.</p>

<p>One other Scottish example of a chesspiece may be mentioned.
It is a small mutilated ivory figure, apparently of a king, in classic
costume, and with a drawn sword in his hand, found a few years since
among the ruins of North-Berwick Abbey. But it belongs to a much
more recent period than any of those previously referred to, and is
inferior to them as a work of art. Were it not, indeed, for the Scandinavian
origin so generally assigned to nearly all the early examples
of British chessmen, their manifest classification among the productions
of Christian art would have rendered it more consistent with
an orderly system of chronology to treat of them along with late
medieval antiquities. The "Collection of Inventories of the Royal
Wardrobe and Jewel House," among its many curious items, furnishes
this interesting notice of the tables and chessmen of James IV., and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>possibly of older Scottish kings:&mdash;"Ane pair of tabillis of silvir, ourgilt
with gold, indentit with jasp and cristallyne, with table men and
chess men of jasp and cristallyne."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> The entry sufficiently shews the
familiarity of the Scottish court with the use both of table and chessmen
at the date of its record, in the reign of James V., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1539.
But evidence is hardly needed to prove the knowledge of a pastime
which was then a favourite in every European court. The tables and
chessmen are entered among the royal jewels, and unfortunately
their costly materials, which admitted of such a classification, render
it vain to hope that they may still be in existence, like the older but
more homely chessmen of Charlemagne.</p>

number of pieces, as well as in some other
and more important points, from that given
in the Archæologia, (vol. xxiv. p. 212.) Sir
F. Madden, however, only describes those
which were acquired by the Trustees of the
British Museum. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharp,
Esq., to whom I owe these particulars, possesses
eleven pieces, consisting of two kings,
three queens, three bishops, one knight,
and two warders. Ten of these he selected
from the whole, previous to their possessor,
Mr. Roderick Ririe, offering them to the
Trustees. The remaining one was afterwards
obtained from a person residing in
Lewis. Sir F. Madden is also mistaken in
speaking of their having been long subject
to the action of salt-water. They were found
at some distance from the shore; a sudden
and very considerable inroad having been
made by the sea. A minute of the Society
of Scottish Antiquaries, referring to the exhibition
of these chessmen, 11th April 1831,
describes them as "found buried fifteen feet
under a bank of sand." Mr. Sharp has in
his possession the original receipt given to
Mr. Ririe by the jeweller in Edinburgh,
with whom they were deposited, which describes
them as "fifty-eight figures, thirty-four
pieces, and a buckle of ivory or bone."</p></div>

that Mr. Sharp's attention was called to it for

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

PRIMITIVE ECCLESIOLOGY.</h3>


<p>With the introduction of Christianity into Britain an entirely new
era of art begins, derivable here, as elsewhere, from the central heart
of ancient Christendom, as in the celebrated example of the Candida
Casa, built at Whithern, in Galloway, in the Roman style.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/image582.jpg" width="489" height="581" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We have the authority of Bede for the fact already referred to,&mdash;that
the first churches of the Britons were constructed of timber. The
cathedral of St. Asaph, founded by St. Kentigern in the sixth century,
was a wooden church, after the manner of the Britons, and so
also we may believe was the first cathedral of Glasgow, the work of
the same founder. The first cathedral
of the Isles seems not even
to have aspired to the dignity of a
wooden church, but to have been
only a wattled inclosure, not unsuited
to the simplicity of the primitive
apostle of the Picts. Similar
erections were probably employed
at a much later period, for the
temporary accommodation of the
first phalanx of the newly founded
monastery. A very curious seal,
attached to one of the older charters
of Holyrood Abbey, represents
a structure so entirely differing from all the usual devices of
the earliest ecclesiastical seals, that I am strongly inclined to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
upon it as an attempt to represent the original wooden church, reared
by the brethren of the Holyrood Abbey, on their first clearance in
the forest of Drumselch. It manifestly represents a timber structure.
The round tower is also curiously consistent with the older
Scottish style, which the Romanesque was then remodelling or
superseding, but bears no analogy to that of the Abbey of St. David.
The contemporary seal of St. Andrews, which has for its device the
venerable metropolitan church of St. Rule, proves that such portraiture
was actually attempted and successfully practised at the
period.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Viewed in this light the old Holyrood seal is one of the most
interesting ecclesiological relics we possess, figuring, it may be, the
primitive structure first reared on the site which is now associated with
so many of the most momentous occurrences both in the ecclesiastical
and civil history of Scotland. The earliest charter to which it has
yet been found attached is a notification by Alwyn, Abbot of Holyrood,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1141; but both the style of workmanship and the curiously
mixed lettering manifestly belong to an earlier period, when the <i>mos</i>
<i>Scotorum</i> was still in use, and perhaps point to the existence of a
<i>familia</i>, or Christian community established in the glades of Drumselch
Forest, long before the royal foundation of the Holyrood. Amid such
primitive structures, the Candida Casa of St. Ninian must have stood
forth as a majestic example of Italian art, and have furnished a
model which succeeding builders would strive to imitate. Yet as
each country of Christian Europe has its own peculiar variations
from the theoretical standard, or its provincialisms, as they may
be fitly enough called, so Scotland and Ireland, occupying originally
a more isolated position than the other kingdoms of Christendom,
modified these to a remarkable extent, and produced a style differing
so greatly from the Italian model as to confound the speculations of
modern ecclesiologists. The masterly essay of Dr. Petrie on "The
Round Towers of Ireland," has at length freed this inquiry from the
cumbrous theories of older antiquaries, and given consistency to the
archæological records of native art.</p>

<p>While England has her Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical remains, exhibiting
more or less of the transition by which the debased Roman
passed into the pure Romanesque, or Norman style, Scotland, along
with Ireland, possesses examples of an early native style belonging to
the same period, anterior to the Norman invasion, and distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
by more marked and clearly defined characteristics. The peculiarities
of the early masonry have generally been selected by judicious ecclesiologists
as one of the most unerring guides to genuine Saxon remains,
including such constructive features as the varieties of <i>long</i>
<i>and short work</i>, whether introduced plainly in the angles of the buildings,
or in the form of pilaster-strips, panels, arcades, and other decorations
on the surface of the walls, as in the celebrated Earl's Barton
Tower, Northamptonshire, and in Stanton Lacy Church, Shropshire.
The latter are only modifications of the simpler long and short work,
and are obviously introduced for the same purpose, namely, to supply
the want of a sufficiency of good building materials, and to bind
together the unsubstantial ruble-work between, much in the same way
as beams and brick-work are united in a timber-framed house. This
difficulty of obtaining a sufficient supply of stone accounts for the introduction
of herring-bone work, consisting of courses of bricks or tiles
of Roman shape, and not unfrequently the spoils of older Roman buildings,
disposed in alternate chevron rows. Such evidence is not of
course in itself sufficient to fix a building as undoubtedly belonging
to the Anglo-Saxon period, but as it generally occurs along with
features more or less markedly distinct from the earliest Romanesque
buildings to which an authentic date is assigned, it is a mere disputing
about terms to question the existence of many well known examples
in England of a style of ecclesiastical building popularly known as
Saxon architecture. In addition to these constructive features there
are not wanting peculiarities of detail, such as the belfry windows,
divided with a rude baluster, or a slender cylindrical shaft carrying a
long impost without any capital, and small apertures both in doors
and windows, formed by two or more stones laid so as to form a
straight slope, and producing a class of pointed openings coeval with
the earliest circular arch in our ecclesiastical architecture. Sculptured
decoration is rare, and generally extremely rude. The imposts of
arches most frequently present imperfect imitations of Roman mouldings,
where they are not simple square blocks, though in some instances
a modification of the long and short work, consisting of rag-stone
regularly disposed in imitation of carved mouldings, serves as
an economical substitute for more laboured decorations.</p>

<p>Most of these characteristics of Anglo-Saxon architecture are, in
the true sense of the word, provincialisms, not indeed necessarily
confined to England, but pertaining to the earliest buildings of dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>tricts
where good stone is scarce, and not easily procured. They form
interesting examples of the legitimate origin of architectural details
from the necessities of the locality in which they are found. On this
very account, however, they are such as we should not expect to find,
either in Scotland or Ireland, where substantial building materials
abound. Examples, indeed, of analogous workmanship are not wanting
in either country, and some of those of Scotland will be referred
to. The celebrated ruin of St. Anthony's Chapel, near Edinburgh,
though certainly not earlier than the fourteenth, and more probably
belonging to the fifteenth century, affords a curious instance of the
adaptation of the rude materials of its immediate site, where others
of the best quality were of easy access. This, however, is a solitary
example, and no indication of a prevalent custom. Any evidence
of such an exotic style as that usually called Saxon in the south
of England transplanted to these localities, like the Scoto-Roman
masonry already described, would clearly point to a foreign origin,
and to builders unfamiliar with the facilities of a stone country.</p>

<p>The peculiar characteristics of the later ecclesiastical revolutions of
Scotland, which almost entirely eradicated all veneration for the
historical memorials of the ancient Scottish Church, have largely
contributed to obliterate the evidences of our primitive Christian
architecture. Some few examples of singular value, however, exist
to attest the correspondence of the earliest sacred structures with
other contemporary works of art. Scotland, as well as Ireland, has
still her round towers, among the earliest and most interesting relics
of native ecclesiastical architecture. Into the endless controversy of
which these have formed the subject it is happily no longer needful
to enter. Dr. Petrie's admirable work has sufficed to sweep away the
learned dust and cobwebs laboriously accumulated about the inquiry
into their origin, and exhibits the value of patient investigation and
the logical deductions of a thoroughly informed mind, in contrast
to the vague and visionary speculations of the fireside student. The
field which the Scottish antiquary has to investigate is narrow indeed
when compared with that which Ireland offers; but is on that very
account freed from some of the difficulties which beset the explorer
into the corresponding Irish examples of the architectural taste and
skill of a remote and long unknown period. It is even possible that
a closer investigation of the history of the round towers of Scotland
may throw some additional light on those of the sister isle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span></p>

<p>It is with extreme hesitation that I venture to hint a doubt in regard
to any of the conclusions arrived at in the "Ecclesiastical Architecture
of Ireland anterior to the Anglo-Norman Invasion," regarding
it, as I do, as a nearly perfect model of critical analysis and research.
Yet even Dr. Petrie occasionally seems not to have entirely escaped
the influence of that temptation to assign the remotest conceivable
antiquity to these national monuments, which proved so effectual a
stumblingblock to his predecessors. Notwithstanding the evidence
adduced for the date assigned to the erection of the Round Tower of
Kildare, it is impossible to overlook the fact, that the doorways both
of that and of the tower at Timahoe are decorated with ornaments
and mouldings, which, though not without their own peculiar details,
essentially correspond to those found throughout Europe on works
of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. If the record of erection at
a particular date, with the absence of any notice of rebuilding, were
to be accepted in proof of the date of styles, there is probably no single
phase of medieval ecclesiastical architecture which might not be proved
on such evidence to be coeval with the earliest. The silence of all
authorities as to the re-erection of churches once built is a species of
negative proof of the smallest possible value. In the ruined nave of
Holyrood Abbey at Edinburgh, the experienced eye may detect work
of nearly every period from the twelfth to the seventeenth century;
yet in some places the mouldings of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries are so ingeniously engrafted on the original Romanesque
work, that it is hardly possible precisely to define the amount of
change. The ingenuity with which the old masons have thus remodelled
churches to bring them into correspondence with the progressive
developments of pointed architecture, completely baffles the attempt
to fix from single examples, such as the remarkable doorway of
Timahoe, the work of a precise date. The form of arch, the chevron
mouldings, decorated capitals, the sculptures on the imposts, are all
such as the experienced eye would assign to the era of the Romanesque
or Anglo-Norman style; and this idea is rather strengthened
than weakened by the finely-jointed character of the ashlar-work, as
such well-finished masonry is rarely met with in any English edifice
prior to the twelfth century. The well-known details common to the
Romanesque style are undoubtedly accompanied, as might be expected,
by others peculiar to Ireland; but these examples referred to
do not differ more from any twelfth century building in England or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
Scotland than does the beautiful stone-roofed Church of Cormac, on
the Rock of Cashel, to which Dr. Petrie assigns, on indisputable evidence,
the date of 1134. I am induced to direct attention to these
points&mdash;otherwise foreign to the subject in hand&mdash;because the few
marked characteristics which can be referred to on the round towers
of Scotland correspond with those in Ireland which, according to all
received ecclesiological analogies, seem to indicate an earlier date than
the towers of Timahoe or Kildare, or the presumed contemporary
monastery of Rathairn, and can hardly be supposed to be works of
a later period. On this point I find it difficult to follow Dr. Petrie,
who assigns to these specimens of ecclesiastical architecture, marked
by details corresponding with works of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries in England and Scotland, a date not later than the close
of the eighth century, while the tower of Donaghmore, which bears
considerable resemblance to the Scottish
round tower at Brechin&mdash;though
greatly inferior in the amount or richness
of ornament&mdash;is ascribed to the
early part of the tenth century, or fully
a century prior to the date of the corresponding
Scottish building. Yet
there are also points of resemblance of
a sufficiently marked character, both in
the peculiar masonry and details of
the Timahoe and Brechin Towers. The
pellet and bead moulding on the soffit
of the former also very closely corresponds
with the finish of the architrave in the Scottish doorway,
though their decorations otherwise greatly differ.</p>

</div>

<p>The well-known round towers of Scotland are those of Abernethy
and Brechin; but in addition to these we have the ancient church
and tower of St. Magnus, Egilshay, in Orkney, which, though hitherto
generally overlooked from its remote and inaccessible position, is no
less interesting and worthy of note. The little church of St. Magnus,
on the island of Egilshay, still remains in tolerably perfect condition
though roofless, consisting of a chancel, nave, and round tower at its
west end, which appears, when perfect, to have been between fifty and
sixty feet high. It was roofed with an irregular dome-shaped capping,
and both the nave and chancel were also protected, at no very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
distant period, with a roofing of stone. Dr. Hibbert, in his "Description
of the Shetland Isles," refers to this little Orkney edifice as a
specimen of the ancient Scandinavian Church, corresponding, as he
conceives, to others which formerly existed in Shetland. After describing
Burra, St. Ronan's, and other localities in the Bay of Scalloway,
he goes on to remark,&mdash;"On an adjacent promontory, named
Ireland, once stood a church which was adorned with a lofty steeple.
But of three buildings of this kind situated in Ireland, Burra, and
Tingwall, that were said to have been erected by Norwegian sisters,
it is unfortunate that not one should now remain."<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> It is in illustration
of the presumed appearance of these that the church of Egilshay
is referred to as "a small religious edifice in Orkney, which these
kirks of Shetland are said to have much resembled."</p>

<p>The date of these churches, which tradition thus assigns to Norwegian
builders, is not known. If, however, we were to take the
dedication of the one still remaining on the island of Egilshay as a
clue to the whole, we should be compelled to assign them to a comparatively
recent period, and one later by more than a century than
the most modern of the round towers of the mainland.</p>

<p>According to well-known Scandinavian records, the introduction of
Christianity into the Orkney Islands was effected by the Norwegian
king Olaf Trigvason, better known to us as St. Olaf, on his return
from an expedition to Ireland in the year 998, having himself received
baptism not long before in the Scilly isles. This important
change, however, which the warrior missionary characteristically
effected at the edge of the sword, there is good reason for believing
only affected the Norwegian jarls. Christianity, as has been already
shewn, had long preceded the conquest of these islands by the Northmen.
The missionaries of Iona had not been so effectually scared by
the intrusion of these fierce invaders as to abandon the numerous
scenes of their early labours; and it is entirely consistent, both with
the history of the northern islands and the characteristics of the primitive
little edifice referred to, to believe that the church which still
stands, though in ruin, on the island of Egilshay was the scene of Christian
rites, amid "the storm-swept Orcades," when the rude Norse
king landed his strange missionary crew on the neighbouring isle.</p>

<p>It can hardly admit of doubt that the simple little church and
tower of St. Magnus, Egilshay, were built from Irish models. Even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
its origin were satisfactorily traced to Norwegian founders, the frequent
expeditions of the Northmen to Ireland would suffice to account
for this. St. Olaf visited Ireland before his memorable visit
to the Orkneys, on his way to Norway, bent on introducing the new
faith into his own country. Sigurd, the Jarl whom he converted by
the summary alternative of embracing Christianity or forfeiting his
dominions, fell in the great battle of Clontarf, in Ireland, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1014,
in which Danes and Northmen of Northumberland, the Orkneys,
Hebrides, and Man, fought along with other foreign auxiliaries, on
behalf of the Danish colonists of Ireland, against the famous Irish
monarch, Brian Boru, while among his allies were the Scottish Maormors
of Lennox and Marr. Gray's celebrated ode of "The Fatal
Sisters" is a paraphrase of an ancient poem in the Icelandic Saga,
on the battle in which the Northmen suffered so terrible a defeat.
In this contemporary poem, Hilda, the Scandinavian goddess of war
and victory, is introduced with her weird-sisters, the Valkyries, who
attended on the field of slaughter to convey the spirits of the dying
heroes to the hall of Odin, and otherwise received in the Scandinavian
mythology nearly the same attributes as the <i>Parcæ</i> of the Greeks.
These Scandinavian Fates are represented as having been seen at
Caithness, in Scotland, by a man named Darraudar, on the very day
of the battle of Clontarf. They were on horseback, riding swiftly towards
a hill, into which they entered, and on looking through an
opening of the rock he saw twelve gigantic females weaving a web at
a strange loom. Their shuttles were weapons of war, their warp was
weighted with human heads, and they wove with human entrails the
ghastly texture of "the loom of hell." As they plied their shuttles
they sang a dreadful incantation, on finishing which they tore the
web into twelve pieces, and each taking her portion they mounted
their black steeds and rode off, six to the north and six to the south.
That same day they appeared on the field of Clontarf busied amid
the heaps of the slain. Such was the creed of the Norse Jarls sixteen
years after the conversion of Sigurd of Orkney by St. Olaf, and the
sole fruit of their last visit to Ireland. It is not to them, therefore,
that we must look for the introduction of the models of the first
Christian churches of Orkney. It is much more probable that the
earlier missionaries of St. Columba were themselves the architects of
the humble little fane which remains on the island of Egilshay, as
well as of many others that once adorned the neighbouring isles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
It closely corresponds in general characteristics with Dr. Hibbert's
account of the ancient churches of Shetland, of which traces still
exist. "All the ecclesiastical buildings," he remarks, "appear to
have been devoid of the least show and ornament, the ingenuity of
the architect extending little farther than in constructing a round
vaulted roof. The pointed arch, the pinnacled buttresses, or rich
stone canopy, never dignified the chapels of humble Hialtland. The
number of them, however, was remarkably great. The parish of Yell,
for instance, boasted twenty chapels, where only two or three are
used at the present day."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> The venerable little Church of Egilshay
has fallen into like decay, and the inhabitants are now compelled to
seek a place of worship on a neighbouring island.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 668px;">
<img src="images/image590.jpg" width="668" height="327" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>St. Magnus's Church, Egilshay.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Like other Orkney buildings of very different dates, this primitive
church is constructed almost entirely of the unhewn clay-slate of the
district. The tower is unsymmetrical, tapering somewhat irregularly
towards the top, and bulging considerably on the side attached to
the church. It differs from other examples in having no external
doorway. It has evidently been built contemporaneously with the
church, and is entered from the nave by means of a door through the
west wall. The accompanying view from the south-east will help to
convey some idea of its external appearance. Since the view engraved
in Dr. Hibbert's Plate of Antiquities was drawn, the stone
roofs both of the church and tower have disappeared, along with a
portion of the walls of the latter, which was taken down from the ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>prehended
danger of its falling. The following are the proportions
of the church and tower. The greatest circumference of the tower
is forty-eight feet, and its present height about forty-five feet. There
is no appearance of any stair having been constructed in it, but two
beams of oak near the top, and two lower down, still indicate the
arrangement of the floors by which it has at one time been subdivided.
Directly above the door on the eastern side, connecting it
with the nave, are the only two windows in the tower, one above the
other, arched with unhewn stone. The doorway is only four feet in
height from the present floor, and two feet four inches broad. The
walls of the nave are about three feet thick, and it measures thirty
feet long by sixteen feet wide within the walls. It is entered both
on the north and south sides by doorways constructed "<i>more Romano</i>,"
with a plain semicircular arch of unhewn stone. On the
north side there is but one small arched window, three feet three
inches in height, and only nine inches wide; while on the south side,
in addition to a corresponding window of similar size, there are two
other plain square-headed windows, measuring respectively two feet
eleven inches by one foot two inches, and one foot nine inches by one
foot one inch. The chancel is still covered in with a plain semicircular
arch, above which has been a chamber, constructed between it
and the outer covering of stone, and accessible only by an entrance
over the chancel arch, where in all probability was kept the muniment
chest of the officiating priest. Such an arrangement is traceable
in early Irish churches, as in the original work of the beautiful
church at Rathain, in King's county, which Dr. Petrie assigns as
the work of St. Fidhairle Ua Suanaigh, who died in 763.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The
chancel measures within the walls eleven feet by nine feet seven
inches, and is lighted only by a small window in the north and south
walls, measuring each twenty by eleven inches. But perhaps the
most singular feature of this interesting structure is the chancel
arch, which, directly contrary to those of corresponding edifices in
Ireland, has its sides inclined inward towards the base, so as to present
a complete horse-shoe arch. It is scarcely possible to examine
the details of this most interesting relic of early Christian art, without
recognising its manifest correspondence with the primitive Irish
churches of the sixth and seventh centuries, which Dr. Petrie's researches
have rendered so familiar to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

<p>That the little Church of Egilshay existed long prior to the era of
St. Magnus cannot, I conceive, admit of doubt. A comparison of it
with the stately cathedral of Kirkwall, founded little more than thirty
years after the death of the sainted Earl, is alone sufficient to prove
its erection at a period essentially differing from the era of the fully
developed Romanesque. Its later dedication to that favourite northern
saint is abundantly accounted for by the remarkable historical
fact that in its immediate neighbourhood, if not indeed, as the Aberdeen
Breviary states, within this venerable fane, the gentle Magnus
Erlendson was hewn down by his fierce cousin Hacon, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1106. It
affords additional confirmation of the source of the Christianity of the
Northern Isles, that we are told in the same venerable Scottish ecclesiastical
authority, that Magnus commended his soul to the Redeemer, to
St. Mary, and to the old northern apostles, <i>St. Palladius</i> and <i>St. Serf</i>.
The fame of the sanctity of the martyred Earl of Orkney was speedily
attested, according to the faith of the period, by numerous miracles
wrought at his tomb. Pilgrimages were made to his shrine, and
saintly honours accorded to him, not in Orkney only, but throughout
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and the Scottish mainland.
Within twenty years after his death the legendary incidents of his
life had been woven into an Icelandic Saga, strangely differing from
that of Hilda and her attendant Valkyries. Ronald, the nephew of
the martyred Earl, obtained a grant from the King of Norway of the
possessions which were his by right of succession to his uncle, and on
successfully establishing his claims the cathedral of St. Magnus at
Kirkwall was begun in or about the year 1138, in fulfilment of a vow
he had made while fortune still hung doubtful in the scale.</p>

<p>The reputation of the sainted Earl has outlived that of any other
Scottish saint, if we except the good St. Margaret. His name is still
spoken with reverence throughout Orkney and Shetland, independently
of all idea of saintship or martyrdom, to which indeed his
claims are greatly more doubtful than his just title to the character
of an upright ruler in a barbarous age. He died in a private quarrel
with his own cousin, in which no other questions than those of mutual
interest appear to have been involved. But the Church availed itself
of the reverence which his virtues had inspired; and to this it is no
doubt mainly owing that, notwithstanding the extreme veneration
in which his name was held, little trustworthy information is to be
found regarding him, even in the authorized records of hagiology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
The Aberdeen Breviary styles him "the Apostle of Orkney and the
Hebrides." Other old authorities refer to him as a bishop or missionary
to the Pagans of the north; and a writer in the first Statistical
Accounts<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> winds up a sufficiently amusing attempt at tracing his
history, by shewing the great probability that he was a knight
templar!</p>

<p>The characteristics of the majestic cathedral of the Northern Isles
furnish valuable elements of comparison with other examples of early
ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland; while they completely confirm
the great antiquity of the simple edifice which was deserted as the
see of the Orkney bishops for the stately edifice at Kirkwall dedicated
to the sainted Earl of the Orkneys. If we except the one common
feature of the rounded arch, no elements of comparison exist. The
cathedral is a well-defined example of the late Romanesque style,
bearing no traces of the rudeness or imperfection which might be
looked for in the transition from an humble and homely fane to one of
such pretensions, but distinctly marked as belonging to a later period
than Dunfermline, Kelso, and other of the older Scottish abbeys in
the same style.</p>

<p>Returning to the consideration of the round towers of the Scottish
mainland, the reader will probably be prepared by the previous evidences
of the close affinity traceable between the early Irish and Scottish
arts to assume that these erections, which find a parallel only in
Ireland, are either the work of the Irish Scots or the result of the
intimate intercourse with Ireland which was maintained at a well-ascertained
period of our history. When we consider the close resemblance
between the round towers of Brechin and Abernethy, and
many of those of Ireland, amounting to a complete identity of style,
it seems strange that Scottish antiquaries should have hesitated in
ascribing to the former a Christian origin, after the obscure annals of
the Dalriadic Scots had been cleared up. From these, as we have
already seen, the Irish Scoti had no footing beyond their little territory
in Argyleshire till the middle of the ninth century; and we have
unquestionable evidence that the Romanesque or Anglo-Norman style
had obtained general acceptance in Scotland in the very beginning of
the twelfth century. Between these two periods, therefore, must the
precise date of erection of both the round towers of Brechin and
Abernethy be sought. But this interval is further greatly limited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
the establishment of the third Norwegian kingdom by Thorfinn in
1034. It embraced nearly the whole of the north of Scotland, and
was successfully maintained for thirty years, so that we are almost
unavoidably compelled to assume their date as prior to this earlier
period. The triumph of Thorfinn involved the extinction of the house
of Kenneth MacAlpin, and the extermination of the most powerful
chiefs of the Scottish race. By this we are limited to a period somewhat
short of two centuries, within which it may be assumed that the
Scottish round towers were erected; and with this such historical
evidence as we possess in some degree accords. Neither of them, however,
are the primitive structures reared on these long sacred sites.
The tower of Abernethy, which stands solitary and unroofed, with all
the ancient ecclesiastical adjuncts of a collegiate foundation utterly
effaced, may be very briefly dismissed. Gordon<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> gives its dimensions
as follows: Its elevation is seventy-five feet, wanting the
conical roof which we may assume to have originally crowned its
summit, adding ten or twelve feet to the height. The doorway
which faces the north, and is, as usual, elevated several feet from
the ground, is eight and a half feet high, by two and a half feet
wide, and consists of a plain semicircular-headed opening. The tower
now occupies an angle of the inclosed churchyard, and serves both as
a belfry and clock-tower for the plain modern church; in addition to
which the obsolete iron jougs still attached to it shew that it was also
enlisted in older times in the execution of ecclesiastical discipline.</p>

<p>The Pictish Chronicle records the founding of a church at Abernethy,
by Necton, King of the Picts, who reigned about the year 455.
He dedicated the royal foundation to God and to St. Brigid, and endowed
it with lands, <i>usque ad diem judicii</i>, the boundaries of which
are minutely specified, "from the stone at Apurfeirt to the stone near
Cairfuill," &amp;c.,&mdash;an interesting example of the Hoare Stones or landmarks
of the fifth century. This is further confirmed by Fordun,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> who
quotes an ancient chronicle of Abernethy in corroboration of the earlier
record. Of the precise character of this <i>ecclesia collegiata de Abernethy</i>
of the fifth century, it is now vain to speculate, but most probably,
even for some centuries later, it was only a wooden church
after the manner of the Britons, and so remained until about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 711,
when we learn from Bede of a second Naiton or Necton, King of the
Picts, who sent messengers to the venerable Ceolfrid, abbot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>historian's own monastery of Jarrow, at the mouth of the Wear, inquiring
concerning sundry disputed questions, and praying him to
send architects who, according to the manner of the Romans, should
make a church of stone among his people. The Pictish monarch
qualifies a promise of future obedience to the holy Roman and Apostolic
Church thus naively: "In quantum dumtaxat tam longe a Romanorum
loquela et natione consegregati hunc ediscere potuissent."<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
At what time the royal foundation of Abernethy was remodelled, according
to the fashion indicated by its ancient tower, is not recorded
in any authority that I know of, but it may not improbably be found
noted by some of the Irish annalists from whom Dr. Petrie has already
recovered so large an amount of well-authenticated history. The interest
in it has naturally been greatly diminished by the annihilation
of every vestige of the collegiate buildings except the tower. Its
masonry, however, closely corresponds to that of Brechin, while the
character of its upper windows is suggestive of even a more recent
period, and it is probable that they are additions of a later date than
the original structure.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical foundation of Brechin, so far as we know, is
fully four centuries later than that of Abernethy, and belongs to the
era of the kings of the Scottish race. The ancient Pictish Chronicle
concludes in the reign of Kenneth, the son of Malcolm, 967-991, and
is supposed to have been written at that early period. It sums up
the brief record of his reign in these words: "This is he who gave the
great city of Brechin to the Lord." It does not perhaps necessarily
follow that no earlier church existed at Brechin; but to this period
we may assign, on the authority of the ancient Chronicle, the first
royal foundation; and in the absence of other evidence, I should have
felt little hesitation in fixing it as the period when the present round
tower was built. Dr. Petrie, however, assigns a date about thirty
years later, and promises more precise information derived from the
Irish annalists, from whence we may hope for other valuable additions
to the <i>Annales Scotorum</i>. Meanwhile, we have obtained an approximation
to the desired date, concerning which the indefatigable investigator
of the history of these peculiar structures only remarks, "The
round tower of Brechin in Scotland there is every reason to believe
was erected about the year 1020, and by Irish ecclesiastics."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> In
dimensions this ancient structure somewhat exceeds that of Abernethy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>measuring eighty-five feet to the cornice,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> above which a roof
or spire of later date has been added when the cathedral church was
re-erected in the thirteenth century. In every other respect it offers
superior attractions to that of Abernethy, surrounded as it is with the
more recent yet venerable and characteristic memorials of ancient
ecclesiastical art, and adorned with sculptures of a singular and very
remarkable character. The masonry of the tower, as will be seen from
the drawing of the doorway, is of that kind which has been traced as
gradually arising out of the cyclopean work of ancient Greece. The
stones are polygonal, carefully hewn, and fitted to each other with the
utmost neatness and art; the courses of masonry being mostly horizontal,
though with more or less irregularity, and the joints not uniformly
vertical. It is the same style of work which characterizes the
walls of the ancient cities of Etruria, and is also found in Ireland to
have succeeded to the ruder primitive cyclopean masonry. But the
peculiar feature of the Brechin Tower is its sculptured doorway. Its
dimensions are as follows: The breadth at the spring of the arch is
one foot seven and a half inches, and at the base one foot eleven inches.
The height of the entrance to the centre of the arch is six feet one
and a half inch, and the entire height of the doorway from the base
of the external ornament to the summit of the crucifix which surmounts
the centre of the arch, is eight feet eleven and a half inches.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span></p>
<p>The sculptured figures cut in relief on the imposts and at the base
of the doorway, are unhappily too much defaced to admit of a very
distinct idea being now formed of their original appearance. Mr.
Gough, who examined and made drawings of them eighty years
since, when they may be presumed to have been somewhat more perfect,
thus describes this ancient doorway: "On the west front are
two arches, one within the other, in relief; on the point of the outermost
is a crucifix, and between both, towards the middle, are figures
of the Virgin Mary and St. John, the latter holding a cup with a
lamb."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> But it was unhappily too much the fashion with antiquaries
of the last century, to see what they desired, and to make their
drawings accordingly, so that little value can be attached to this
precise description. One of the figures holds a pastoral staff, and the
other may perhaps have borne a mitre. They were, not improbably,
originally designed to represent St. Serf, St. Columba, or some other
of the favourite primitive Scottish saints. The larger of the two
measures one foot eleven inches in height, including the pedestal or
block of stone on which it stands. The nondescript animals below
no less effectually baffle any attempts at description. "If one of
them," says Gough, "by his proboscis had not the appearance of an
elephant, I should suppose them the supporters of the Scotch arms!"
Pennant, undeterred by the <i>proboscis</i>,&mdash;which, indeed, even now
looks more like a fish in the animal's mouth,&mdash;conceives them more
probably to be the Caledonian bear and boar. The lapse of eighty
years has not added to their distinctness, and little good can be
hoped for from such random guessings. But the two upper blocks
supply curious and unmistakable evidence of the fact, that the original
design of the old sculptor has been abruptly brought to a close.
Additional figures&mdash;not improbably ministering angels&mdash;have mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>festly
been intended to be introduced on either side of the crucified
Redeemer, but from some cause&mdash;possibly yet ascertainable from
the Irish annalists&mdash;the work of decoration has been arrested, and
the unshapen blocks have been left to be fashioned by the tooth of
time.</p>

<p>To these few examples of ecclesiastical buildings belonging to a
period prior to the development of the architecture of Medieval
Europe, I have little doubt that further research, particularly in the
Hebrides and the neighbouring coasts of the mainland, may still supply
some interesting additions. This volume has been delayed in the
hope of being able to accomplish a tour sketched out for that purpose,
but the plan must be executed at a future time, and most probably
by other investigators, who possess all the requisites for its efficient
accomplishment. It is exceedingly likely that some of the primitive
oratories of the first centuries of Scottish Christianity still exist on
the remote sites frequently chosen by the ascetic missionaries of the
faith. Martin, for example, after describing the Eird Houses or
Weems of the Western Isles, adds,&mdash;"There are several little stone-houses
built above ground, capable only of one person, and round in
form; one of them is to be seen in Portry, another at Linero, and at
Culunock. They are called <i>Tey-nin-druinich</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Druid's House."<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
Again, the Old Account of the Parish of Orphir, in Orkney, furnishes
the following description:&mdash;"In the churchyard are the remains of
an ancient building, called the Girth House, to which great antiquity
is ascribed. It is a rotundo eighteen feet in diameter, and twenty
feet high, open at top; and on the east side is a vaulted concavity,
where probably the altar stood, with a slit in the wall to admit the
light; two-thirds of it have been taken down to repair the parish
church. The walls are thick, and consist of stones, strongly cemented
with lime. From its resemblance to the Pantheon, some have ascribed
this building to the Romans; but in all probability it has been a
chapel, dedicated by the piety of its founder to some favourite saint."<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
These seem, like the more celebrated Arthur's Oon, to answer in
description to the small circular structures familiar to Irish antiquaries
as bee-hive houses, and which are believed to have been the abodes
of ancient ecclesiastics. Even on Arthur Seat, exposed to the restless
populace of the neighbouring city, some remains of the simple cell of
the Hermit of St. Anthony are still visible, and on the Island of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>Inchcolm, in the Frith of Forth, a rudely arched little vault, of uncertain
age and sufficiently primitive construction, adjoining the
ruined monastery over which the historian, Abbot Bowar, presided,
is shewn as the cell of the good Hermit of St. Columba, where he
entertained King Alexander I. for three days, when driven on the
island by a tempest. The adjacent monastic buildings still include
remains of various early dates, some of which will come under review
in the following chapter; but an interesting memorial of the original
monastery has been preserved on the chapter seal, which&mdash;like some
of those of the metropolitan see figured with the primitive Cathedral
of St. Rule&mdash;is engraved with a view of the ancient Abbey Church
of Inchcolm. In style of art the seal bears considerable resemblance
to those of St. Andrews. The church is represented consisting of nave
and choir, with a central tower surmounted by a spire, and with plain
round-headed windows in the choir. The only impressions yet discovered
are very imperfect; but little doubt can be entertained that in
these we have a representation of the original structure of the twelfth
century, fully as accurate and trustworthy as we are enabled to ascertain
the ancient seals of St. Andrews to have been. Thus does wax
and parchment outlive the graven brass and the masonry which
seemed to bid defiance to time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

MEDIEVAL ECCLESIOLOGY.</h3>


<p>The subject of Medieval Ecclesiology is much too comprehensive to
be treated with attention proportionate to its extent, and the importance
justly ascribed to it, in the compass of a single chapter.
But some notice of it is indispensable to the completeness of any
systematic treatise on Scottish antiquities; and in attempting this it
becomes once more necessary to glance at the ethnological elements
on which depend the transition from the earlier and simpler characteristics
already noticed. Whatever value be attached to the attempts
advanced in the previous chapter to give some precision to the history
of Primitive Scottish Ecclesiology, little doubt can now be entertained
that throughout the whole period of Celtic rule in Scotland and Ireland,
a peculiar character pervaded the native arts, and greatly
modified the forms of Christian architecture introduced from Italy
along with the new faith. Long, however, before Thorfinn subjected
the Celtic population of the north to the Norwegian yoke, and sanctioned
Macbeth's usurpation of the throne of the Southern Picts, the
Teutonic races from the south were securing a footing in the Lothians.
From the middle of the seventh century the limits of the kingdom of
Northumbria extended to the Forth, and though the Angles maintained
their varying northern frontier only by a constant warfare
with the Picts and Scots, yet the population must have become almost
entirely Teutonic before the recognition of Egbert of Wessex as
bretwalda or chief ruler of England, in 829. In 867, the Danes, a
different branch of the Scandinavian race from the old Scottish
Northmen, conquered the kingdom of Northumbria, and it is not till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
after the accession of the Saxon Athelstane, in 925, that we again
find it partially and temporarily incorporated with the southern kingdoms.
With these portions of English history we have little further
to do than simply to note the evidence they furnish of the same
remarkable changes having affected the population of the Scottish
Lowlands which divided the races of the south into Weals and
Engle-kin, or Celtic and Teutonic; Jutes, Angles, and Saxons, being
comprehended from a very early period under the common name of
Englen or English. The changes which followed on the Danish conquest
again temporarily isolated Northumbria, where Harold Harefoot
established a separate kingdom; and when Macbeth secured the
concurrence of Thorfinn in his accession to Duncan's throne, he included
in his dominions a large portion of the Scottish Northumbria.
To this succeeded the accession of Malcolm Canmore, Duncan's eldest
son, a prince of the old Celtic race, but sharing also through his
mother in the Anglo-Saxon blood, educated at the Court of Edward
the Confessor, and restored to the throne of his fathers chiefly by
the aid of the Northumbrian Saxons.</p>

<p>The establishment of Malcolm on the Scottish throne dates from
the year 1058; but four years prior to this he had succeeded, with
the aid of his uncle, Siward, Earl of Northumberland, and a Saxon
army, in driving Macbeth beyond the Forth, notwithstanding the
strenuous aid of the Northmen, with whom a large portion of the
native Celtic race were then closely allied. From this important
epoch in our national history dates the commencement of that remarkable
revolution known by the name of the "Saxon Conquest." The
Norman triumph at Hastings greatly accelerated its progress. Already
the Scottish Court was the resort of numerous Anglo-Saxon nobles
and leaders, whose services had given them claims on the Scottish
Crown, and whose retainers accompanied them to settle on their new
possessions in the Scottish Lowlands. But the Norman invasion
drove many more to seek from the northern ruler the shelter which
he had found in his adversity at the English Court; nor must we
forget that his own barbarous policy helped to colonize his southern
territories. Leaguing, when it suited his purpose, against the Norman
aggressors, he wasted the country as far as Durham in 1070,
bringing back with him so many prisoners of both sexes, that an old
chronicler remarks,&mdash;"So great was the number of captives, that for
many years they were to be found not only in every Scottish village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
but in every Scottish hovel."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Thus by the most opposite means was
a Saxon population invested in the possession of the Lothians. Norman
adventurers followed, dissatisfied with the Conqueror's rewards,
as the Saxons of old blood were impatient of the Norman yoke. The
Saxon Edward, it will be remembered, had Norman blood in his
veins, spent his early years in Normandy, and when he at length
attained to the English Crown, surrounded himself with Norman
barons and churchmen, and bestowed on them some of the highest
preferments in the kingdom. At his Court, therefore, Malcolm could
acquire no such prejudices against the Norman as animated the expatriated
followers of Harold. To him the discontented Norman baron
with his hardy men-at-arms would be as welcome as the Saxon thane
with his faithful retinue. Both found a ready portion in the fertile
Lothians, in an age when even the multitude of children were "as
arrows in the hands of a mighty man." It was a peaceful and nearly
bloodless revolution, yet by it this northern kingdom was more completely
transformed than by all the protracted struggles of Roman,
Pict, or Northman. The sceptre was still swayed by a prince of the
Celtic line; but the power was passing away for ever from the last
independent representatives of the nomade colonists of Europe.</p>

<p>The victory at Hastings was far less effectual in making England
Norman than in making Scotland Saxon. In this respect the usurpation
of Macbeth, which drove Malcolm to seek refuge and to acquire
his education at the English Court, exercised a remarkable influence
on the future history of both countries, and prepared in requital, a
home for the southern Saxon, which has proved the birthland of the
most vigorous offshoot of the race. But chief among the Anglo-Saxon
fugitives is the noble princess, sister of Edgar Atheling, who
brought to the Scottish throne the civilisation as well as the hereditary
rights of the race of the Confessor. The earlier years of Malcolm's
reign appear to have exhibited all the fiercest characteristics
of a disputed succession; and it is probable that during the long
years of conflict between Northman, Celt, and Saxon, the native arts
and civilisation were greatly deteriorated. Its ecclesiastical system
had suffered no less than its civil arts. The church of St. Columba
had been spoiled of its temporal possessions, and had parted with
many of its canonical usages, including the celibacy of the clergy,
that mainspring of the medieval church, which appears to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
so heartily favoured by the good Abbot of Iona. It is no part of the
plan of this work to embrace ecclesiastical controversies, or to attempt
to settle disputed questions relative to the precise doctrines and practice
of the ancient Culdees. So interesting an inquiry could only be
injured by a superficial notice of the modern disputes relative to their
Episcopal or Presbyterian constitution, and the ancient ones about the
tonsure and the times of observing Easter. Trivial as such controversies
may be thought by some, they appear to have involved questions
of higher moment, including that of the independence of the
Celtic Church. The neglect, if not the entire abnegation of the
celibacy of the clergy for a considerable period prior to the Saxon
Conquest, is, however, indisputable; and the orthodox grandniece of
the Confessor, in giving her hand to Malcolm Canmore, plighted troth
with the legitimate grandchild of an Abbot of Dunkeld. To assume
the primitive purity or simplicity of our early northern Church on such
grounds would be erroneous. It is sufficient for our present purpose
to know that it differed in various important respects from the Roman
Church of western Christendom. The peculiar features which have
attracted our notice in previous chapters originated chiefly from
the isolation of the Scottish Church and nation; but that isolation
was now to come to an end. The Princess Margaret became the
queen of Malcolm Canmore, and the sharer of his throne. Her gentle
spirit, not untinctured by the asceticism of the age, softened the fierce
passions of her husband, and made his wild nature bend obedient to
her will. The grandniece of the Confessor became the reformer of
the Scottish Church, and the redresser of its abuses. Provincial
councils were summoned at her command, at which Malcolm became
the interpreter between the Saxon queen and his Celtic clergy. Her
great aim was to assimilate the Scottish Church to that of England,
and indeed of Rome, neither of which it would seem to have greatly
resembled. To her we chiefly owe the eradication of the Culdees,
(<i>Gille-de</i>, servant of God,) the successors of the first recluses and
monks who established religious fraternities in Scotland, and who
differed latterly from other orders probably more in their laxity as
to monastic observances than on points of faith. Yet there were not
wanting among them even then some worthy representatives of their
primitive missionary founders. The Chartulary of St. Andrews, which
furnishes some curious evidence of their absorption, partly by conformity
and partly by force, into the new orders of canons regular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
also affords some insight into these primitive religious societies not
unsuited to awaken regrets at their arbitrary extinction. The sons
of St. Margaret, Edgar, Alexander, and David, though differing in
nearly every other respect, concurred in carrying out the reformation
by which the Scottish Church was restored to uniformity with the
ecclesiastical standards of the age. Worthy descendants of the Confessor,
they not only made the Church of England their model, but
frequently selected their spiritual directors from its clergy, preferred
English priests to the bishoprics, and peopled their abbeys with its
monks. The "Saxon Conquest" was in truth even more an ecclesiastical
than a civil revolution, and the evidences of its influence are still
abundant after the lapse of upwards of seven hundred years. In the
period which intervened between the landing of the fugitive Saxon
princess at St. Margaret's Hope and the death of her younger son
David, nearly all the Scottish sees were founded or restored, many of
the principal monasteries were instituted, their chapels and other
dependencies erected, and the elder order of Culdee fraternities and
missionary bishops for the first time superseded by a complete parochial
system. It was David I. who ejected the brethren of St. Serf
established on the secluded little isle of Lochleven, and merged both
that and the Culdee house of Monymusk into the new priory of canons
regular of St. Austin established at St. Andrews. We read with no
little interest the brief inventory of the Lochleven library, thus unscrupulously
seized by the "soir sanct." Among its sixteen volumes
were the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the three books of
Solomon, a Commentary on the Song of Solomon, and another on the
book of Genesis:<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> no discreditable indication of the studies of these
recluses of Lochleven, whom some have inclined to rank among the
Protestants of their age. But old things were then passing away
under the guidance of reformers not less zealous than those of the
sixteenth century. An entire change, moreover, necessarily resulted
from the novel relations subsisting between the northern and southern
kingdoms. The seat of Scottish civilisation had hitherto been chiefly
in the north and west, while the Lothians and the southern dales had
been but a debatable land&mdash;the battle-ground oftener than the secure
possession of the Pictish or Scottish kings. On this very account
great facilities existed for its settlement by the southern fugitives,
ready to hold it of the Scottish crown by feudal military tenure, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>to defend it against the aggressions of the new power established in
England. A charter preserved in the treasury at Durham, and belonging
at latest to the very commencement of the twelfth century,
furnishes interesting illustration of the new elements of strength and
progress infused into the kingdom by the colonization of its southern
districts. The charter relates to the founding of the church of Edenham,
on the north bank of the Tweed, in the rural manse of which
the poet of the Seasons was born in the year 1700,&mdash;one also of the
many results which have flowed from that old deed of piety, executed
five centuries before. The settler is Thor the Long, probably neither
of Saxon nor Norman blood, but a descendant of one of Hardacnute's
Danish followers, who established himself on the banks of the Tweed
by invitation of Edgar, the son and successor of Malcolm. The charter
thus describes at once the royal grant and the pious gift of the new
settler, and may very happily serve to illustrate the process of Teutonic
colonization of the Scottish Lowlands: "To all the sons of holy mother
Church, Thor the Long, greeting in the Lord: Be it known that
Aedgar, my Lord, King of Scots, gave to me Aednaham, a desert; that
with his help and my own money I peopled it, and have built a church
in honour of St. Cuthbert; which church, with a ploughgate of land,
I have given to God, and to St. Cuthbert and his monks, to be
possessed by them for ever."<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Such was in reality the process by
which the "Saxon Conquest" was accomplished. No wonder that
it should be unnoticed by contemporary chroniclers, and remain a
puzzle to historians who esteem wars and regal successions the sole
indices of the past. It was wastes not men that had to be conquered,
and therefore the victory is chronicled alone in such brief parentheses
as that of the Edenham charter.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how complete a change must necessarily have
taken place on the ecclesiastical architecture of Scotland at the period
of its receiving so great an impulse. The Christian arts, introduced
to a great extent along with the new faith from Ireland, had hitherto
been modified chiefly by local influences. The reformation effected
by Queen Margaret and her sons abruptly arrested the development
of a peculiar native style, and made the architecture of England
as well as its ecclesiastical system supply the new Scottish
model. With the elevation of the Saxon princess to the Scottish
throne, we for the first time discover a chronological coincidence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
the styles of the ecclesiastical architecture of Scotland and England.
In the sixth year of the reign of Malcolm II., the grandfather of
Duncan, <i>i.e.</i>, in 1010, according to a charter of doubtful value, which
has been the subject of no little diversity of opinion,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> he gave to God,
the blessed Mary, and all the saints, the church of Mortlach or Murthelach,
in perpetual gift, erecting it into an Episcopal see, in obedience,
as it is said, to a vow made in the immediate vicinity of the
church when battling with the Norwegian Invaders. In its present
form the charter seems to be unworthy of implicit credit, yet the circumstantial
accounts of Fordun and Boece agree with it in every
essential point, and it appears reasonable to assume that its most
important features are not without some authority and historical value.
David I. translated the see from Mortlach to Old Aberdeen in 1125,
endowing it for the first time with revenues proportionate to the
dignity of the bishopric. It appears, however, if we may so far
trust the charter, that Mortlach was the seat of a religious foundation
prior to the honours conferred on it by the victorious Malcolm, the
humble church of which was elevated, in fulfilment of the royal vow,
to the rank of a cathedral. At such a date we might expect a building
corresponding to those of which the remarkable relics remain at
Abernethy and Brechin; and even yet, though sorely defaced by modern
additions, the venerable parish church of Mortlach is believed to
include portions of the primitive cathedral. The holes are pointed
out where the victor is affirmed to have caused the heads of three of
the vanquished Norse leaders to be built into the wall as a votive
offering: a singular but sufficiently characteristic memorial of the
ferocious spirit of the age, though resting on little better authority
than local tradition. "At whatever time," says the Old Statist, writing
about 1795, "three skulls may have first been put there, there
they surely were; and not longer than about thirty years ago was
the last of them picked out and tossed about by the school-boys."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
The former proportions of the church were ninety feet long, including
a chancel of twenty-seven feet, while its greatest breadth was only
twenty-eight feet. Within the last twelve years great alterations and
additions have been made, with the usual inattention to the ancient
features of the venerable edifice. The original walls are very massive.
The windows, where unaltered, are extremely narrow and deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>splayed internally, the work probably of the new era which we have
now to consider, though it is not impossible that some portions of
the original church of Mortlach may still remain.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>It was about the year 1070&mdash;the precise date is uncertain&mdash;that
Malcolm Canmore wedded the gentle and pious Saxon princess, whose
amiable disposition insensibly softened the rugged nature of her
husband, and swayed him by the influence of a most sincere affection,
till he became the docile minister of her will. We possess a narrative
of the private life of Malcolm and his Queen, on the authority of
Turgot the confessor of the latter, who had frequent opportunities of
intimate intercourse with both. Amid the austerities and superstitions
which belonged less to the individuals than the age, it is impossible
not to admire the rare picture of domestic charity and kindly
affections which it discloses. It was at Dunfermline, according to
Turgot, that the auspicious marriage of Malcolm and Margaret took
place; and one of the first works of the queen was to found a church
in the place where her nuptials had been celebrated, which she dedicated
to the Holy Trinity, and enriched with many costly gifts. Such
was the origin of the Benedictine Abbey of Dunfermline, though it
can scarcely admit of doubt that some church or chapel existed at
this chosen place of royal residence prior to the foundation of St.
Margaret. The editor of the "Registrum de Dunfermelyn" remarks,
"The original church of Canmore, perhaps hot of stone, must have
been replaced by a new edifice when it was dedicated in the reign of
David I. If any part of that structure remain, it must be little more
than the foundations. Age, or the accidents of a rough time, or the
increasing consequence of the house, gave rise to an enlarged and
more magnificent structure about the middle of the thirteenth century."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
It cannot be difficult, I think, to shew that such conclusions
are erroneous, and at least totally inadmissible in reference to the
sombre and impressive nave of Dunfermline, the oldest and perhaps
most interesting specimen of the Romanesque style now remaining in
Scotland. But the whole reasoning proceeds on the imperfect views
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>hitherto entertained of the state of civilisation and the progress of
the arts in Scotland previous to the commencement of its medieval
era, dating from the reign of Malcolm, when for the first time both its
civil and ecclesiastical institutions were assimilated to the rest of
Europe.</p>

<p>So far from Malcolm Canmore's church being probably of wood,
there are some of the most substantial early Romanesque structures
in England which there is good reason for ascribing to the same
builders who erected the Church of the Holy Trinity at Dunfermline,
in the lifetime of its pious foundress. Malcolm was present at the
laying of the foundation stone of Durham Cathedral by the confessor
and biographer of his own pious queen, on the 11th of August 1093,
shortly before his last fatal rupture with England; and his son Alexander
witnessed the deposition of the relics of St. Cuthbert in the same
sacred edifice in 1104. No one who has had the opportunity of examining
both Durham and Dunfermline, can have failed to observe the
remarkable correspondence of their character and details. The same
massive and dissimilar piers: the same chevron, spiral, and billet
mouldings distinguishing the compartments of the nave: the same
chamfered cushion capitals to the heavy cylindrical shafts: as well
as a marked conformity in many minor details, all point to a common
origin for Durham Cathedral and Dunfermline Abbey. St. Finnan,
a monk of Iona, is said to have built the first church of Lindisfarne,
a timber erection, and the original seat of the see of Durham, in the
seventh century. Scottish missionaries twice introduced the faith into
Northumberland; Iona and Melrose supplied successive heads to the
southern house; and even after the Conqueror compelled the chapter
to receive a bishop of his appointment of Norman blood, the intimate
relations between the see and the northern abbeys appear to have
been very temporarily interrupted. In so far as greater plainness
and massive simplicity afford any ground for assigning priority of
date, the argument is in favour of the greater antiquity of Dunfermline
Abbey, which must have been far advanced, if not indeed finished,
according to the original design, before the foundation of the
Cathedral at Durham was laid in 1093, as the death of both of the
royal founders took place before the close of the year; and they were
buried there before the rood altar. Perhaps the fact of their interment
there, and not in the choir,&mdash;to which the bodies of both were
translated with solemn ceremonial and, according to the old chroni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>clers,
with miraculous attestations of their enduring affection,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> four
years after the canonization of St. Margaret in 1246,&mdash;may be thought
to afford presumptive evidence that the abbey choir was then incomplete.
This, however, is by no means probable, as the choir was always
the part of the church first built. But it was no doubt with a view
to receive into a structure worthy of so sacred a depository the relics
of the sainted queen that the choir was remodelled according to the
prevailing First-pointed style of the thirteenth century. We possess a
curious proof that even the reconstruction of the choir was effected,
not by demolishing and rebuilding the whole, but merely by remodelling
the original masonry of the eleventh and twelfth centuries,&mdash;a
process of common occurrence with nearly all the large cathedral and
abbey churches; for by a bull of Pope Innocent IV., dated September
15, in the seventh year of his pontificate,<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> (1250,) he dispenses with
the reconsecration of the abbey, because the walls of the former church
for the most part still remained.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> No doubt the nave also underwent
some modifications, of which it now bears evidence, but all its
essential features can be assigned to no other period than that of the
original foundation.</p>

<p>To the same early period must be assigned the erection of the interesting
little chapel of St. Margaret in the Castle of Edinburgh,
which it was my good fortune to rediscover a few years since, when
converted to the vile use of a powder magazine, after its very existence
had been lost sight of for upwards of a century.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Some of its
characteristic details have been thought rather to belong to the later
period of the Romanesque style; but a careful examination of the
simple capitals of the jam-shafts, and the low relief of the mouldings
on the chancel arch, has satisfied me that there is no evidence in
its structure inconsistent with the idea of its being the oratory of
Queen Margaret, which, according to Barbour, she caused to be decorated
with a painting of prophetic import, still remaining in his day,<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
(obiit 1396.) The plain coved vault of the apse, and the small round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>headed
and entirely unornamented windows, so different from the
later work of Dalmeny or Leuchars, confirm this opinion. By a charter
bearing date 14th February 1390, King Robert II. endowed the
altar of the chapel of St. Margaret the Queen, in Edinburgh Castle,
with a yearly rental of eight pounds, but which was subsequently
transferred to the chapel of St. Mary the Virgin, in the same fortress,
probably erected at that period, and only demolished towards the close
of the last century.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The great improbability of the oratory of Queen
Margaret having been demolished, and so small and plain a chapel
built in her honour either in the reign of Alexander or David, seems
to render the conclusion unavoidable, that the interesting little chapel
of St. Margaret is directly associated with the pious queen, to whom
there can be little doubt Shakespear alludes in Macbeth, though he
makes Macduff speak of her not as the wife but the mother of Malcolm:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The portions which remain of the original Romanesque structure
of Alexander I.'s foundation on Inchcolm, erected about 1123, are
characterized by the same unornate simplicity; nor is it till the reign
of David I. that we have any certain examples of the highly decorated
late Romanesque work. Even in the Abbey of Jedburgh much
of the original work is heavy and plain, compared with the singularly
rich details which lighten the solid masses of Kelso Abbey. Of Holyrood
Abbey, founded by David I. in the same year with that of Kelso,
comparatively little use can be made in fixing the chronology of
Scottish medieval architecture. From its vicinity to the capital, and
its long occupation by the Court, every invading army spoiled or
burnt it, and almost every abbot made some new additions or repairs,
till it has become a complete ecclesiological enigma. In the cloister
doorway, on the south side of the nave, it presents undoubted remains
of the original foundation of David I. The west tower, the arcades
in the aisles, and various other portions, indicate that the main walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>of the building belong to the transition-period, prior to the complete
development of the First-pointed style; most probably in the minority
of Alexander III. The great west doorway and the centre aisle are
in the very best style of late First-pointed; while the external north
wall and its richly decorated buttresses, as well as various additions
on the south side, are reconstructions of Abbot Crawfurd, who succeeded
to the abbacy in 1457, as appears from his arms still visible
on various parts of the new work. The unique
windows of the west front, with segmental arches
and nondescript tracery, though bearing some
resemblance to portions of the palace in Stirling
Castle, ascribed to the reign of James IV., will, we
suspect, be more correctly assigned to the era of his
unfortunate descendant, Charles I., whose cipher
is carved on the beam of the great doorway below.
The beautiful arcade of early but unusually rich
First-pointed work, and with sculptured heads in
the spandrils, which adorns the west front of the
tower, is in some respects unique, and is certainly
unsurpassed in the richness of its details by any contemporary work.</p>

<p>The cathedral of St. Magnus at Kirkwall, in the Orkneys, has
already been referred to as an exceedingly interesting specimen of
late Romanesque work, commenced about the year 1136; so that
from the banks of the Tweed to these remote northern isles we find
the Romanesque style universally adopted in the first years of the
twelfth century. One curious and unique example of this period,
however, must not be overlooked. The remarkable little church and
tower of St. Rule, at St. Andrews, have excited scarcely less interest
than the round towers of Brechin and Abernethy, and have been the
subjects of equally vague speculations. The slender tower, measuring
upwards of an hundred feet in height, by twenty feet eight inches in
breadth at base, while the choir is only thirty-one and a half feet long,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
is well calculated to arrest the attention, though the edifice is, as a
whole, more remarkable for its singular and perfectly unique features
than for the grace or consistency of its proportions. The remarkable
excess in height over all the other measurements of the tower prevails,
though to a less extent, in the entire design. The accumulated soil
covers the bases of the columns of the chancel arch, and thus detracts
from this peculiar characteristic of the primitive metropolitan cathedral;
but even now, while the interior of the choir measures only nineteen
feet ten inches in breadth, the present height of the chancel arch is
twenty-one and a half feet, and that of the arch in the tower, formerly
connecting the nave and choir, is twenty-four feet two inches; from
the floor to the top of the side walls is twenty-nine feet seven inches,
and to the apex of the original high-pointed roof, as shewn on the
tower wall, is fifty-five feet five inches.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Assuming the existence
of three steps at the chancel arch, we shall not probably err in adding
to all the latter measurements at the least from four to five feet,
thereby presenting a remarkably striking contrast to the very narrow
proportions of the choir. The details are extremely simple. The
sections of the piers and arch mouldings of the chancel figured here
will suffice to shew that they partake somewhat of the meagreness of
the larger features, while they are entirely devoid of the massiveness
so peculiarly characteristic of the older Romanesque. Nevertheless,
in this, as in other details of the building, the architect has shewn
much ingenuity in economizing the limited means and materials at
his command: the tenuity and apparent meagreness of design of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>the chancel arch, as seen in section, producing in reality an effect of
greater breadth and solidity than a number of less distinct and boldly
relieved features could have effected. The columns are finished by
simple double-cushioned capitals, surmounted by a plain chamfered
abacus, from which springs the arch, one of the most singular features
of this curious building. Its details are shewn in the section, but
the arch considerably exceeds a semicircle; and mounted on its lofty
piers, with the tall, narrow tower beyond, presents a remarkable but
by no means unpleasing effect. From the excessive height which
prevails throughout all the most prominent features of the church of
St. Rule, it possesses, as
a whole, little in common
with such sombre
and massive structures
as Kirkwall or Dunfermline,
or with the more
ornate little Romanesque
churches of Leuchars
or Dalmeny. Its
walls, indeed, which
have so well withstood
the tooth of time, are
only two feet seven
inches thick. A careful examination of its details, however, leaves no
room to doubt that it belongs to the twelfth century, when the older
Romanesque was being modified by many novel additions prior to its
abandonment for the First-pointed style; and there can be little
risk of error in recognising in the church of St. Rule the basilica
of Bishop Robert, the founder of the Priory of Canons Regular of
St. Andrews, about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1144. The bishop had much to reform at
St. Andrews ere either his new foundation or his Episcopal see were
placed on the creditable footing in which he left them to his successor;
and we may, with little hesitation, ascribe the singular proportions
of the church of St. Rule to the desire of giving with his
first slender means the utmost dignity that they admitted of to the
metropolitan church. The early chapter seals of St. Andrews afford
some of the few undoubted examples of a designed and tolerably
accurate portraiture of an ancient church. The oldest of these, a seal
attached to a charter <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1160, but itself no doubt of a somewhat
earlier date, shews the miniature cathedral as it probably originally
appeared, with central and west towers, choir, and nave, but altogether
of much smaller dimensions than the greater number of parish
churches. The windows of two lights in the top of the tower may be
compared to the plainer example, divided by a cylindrical shaft, with
cushioned capital, and moulded base, in the lower part of the tower
of Dunblane Cathedral, a fragment of the first cathedral of St. Blane,
possibly of the time of Canmore, and certainly not later than the
reign of Alexander I. But the lighter and more ornate style of those
of St. Rule fully accord with the later date assigned to it here.</p>

<p>Specimens of Romanesque parish churches are by no means rare in
Scotland. Besides those of Leuchars and Dalmeny may be named
Duddingston, Ratho, and Borthwick, Mid-Lothian; Gulane, East-Lothian;
Uphall, Abercorn, and Kirkliston, West-Lothian; St. Helen's,
Cockburnspath, Berwickshire; Mortlach and Monymusk, Aberdeenshire;
St. Columba's Southend, Kilchouslan, Campbeltown, and the
beautiful little ruined church of St. Blane, on the island of Bute, with
its Romanesque chancel arch and graceful First-pointed chancel;
besides various others more or less perfect still remaining in Argyleshire&mdash;all
presenting interesting features illustrative of the development
of the Romanesque style in Scotland, and furnishing evidence
of the great impetus given to church building at the period.</p>

<p>Such was the change effected on Scottish art by the remarkable
historical events which gave the throne of England to the Norman
invader, and established the descendants of the Saxon Alfred on that
of Scotland. For nearly a century the ecclesiastical architecture of
England and Scotland is one in style, coincident in date, and uniform
in the character of details. This unwonted uniformity, however, is
clearly traceable to causes the full effect of which was ere long modified
by other influences. Soon after the introduction of the First-pointed
or Early English style a marked difference is discoverable,
and thenceforth the dates and peculiar characteristics of the ecclesiastical
architecture of the two countries disagree in many essential
points. Notwithstanding the adoption of the somewhat exclusive
term <i>Early English</i> for the First-pointed style, it appears to have
reached its limits at fully as early a period in Scotland as in England.
The choir of Glasgow Cathedral, built by Bishop Jocelin, between
1188 and 1197, though not to be compared with the Cathedral
of Salisbury in loftiness of proportions, or grandeur of effect as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
whole, is certainly further advanced in the rich and finished character
of its beautiful capitals and other varied details, though the English
cathedral was not begun till <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1220, or thirty-two years later than
that of St. Kentigern. The crypt of Glasgow Cathedral, which
formed the first work of Bishop Jocelin, is not surpassed by any
structure of its class, and hardly indeed equalled by any other crypt
in the kingdom. As a specimen of pure First-pointed work it is deserving
of the most careful study; and the recent judicious restorations
effected under the direction of the late Mr. William Nixon, have
rendered it an object which the student of medieval architecture may
visit with unqualified admiration and delight. So little has hitherto
been done in the way of investigating the history or peculiar character
of Scottish Ecclesiology, that very few examples have yet been
assigned to their true date. It has been customary to ascribe the
founding of the cathedral church of St. Andrews, for example, to
Bishop Arnold, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1159-1163, and loosely to assume from this that
a considerable portion of it was of that early date. But the mention
by Wyntoun of his interment in the "auld kyrk,"<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> <i>i.e.</i>, the church
of St. Rule, must be accepted as some indication that the new
cathedral had made no great progress at his death. The beautiful
fragment of its choir which still remains may with little hesitation
be ascribed to the later episcopate of Bishop William, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1202-1233;
during whose occupation of the see we have evidence of considerable
building being in progress. Specimens of pure First-pointed work are
by no means rare in Scotland, ranging from the stately cathedral of
St. Mungo, or the ruined abbey of Dryburgh, to the chancel of the
lovely little church of St. Blane in the Isle of Bute. But with the
exception of the magnificent fragments of the abbey of Aberbrothoc
which still remain to us, no more characteristic specimen of the
peculiar style which arose in Scotland in the reign of William the
Lion can be referred to, than the three eastern bays added to the old
Romanesque cathedral of St. Magnus, in the remote Orkneys. The
details are indeed for the most part First-pointed, and the piers
beautifully moulded and clustered shafts, but the arches that rise
from them are of the same form as those of 1136, though also richly
moulded in conformity with the style which superseded the Romanesque
in the latter part of the twelfth century. Such work can
neither be consistently classed with the true First-pointed, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>Glasgow Cathedral is a type, nor with the later Scottish Decorated.
Down to the close of Malcolm IV.'s reign the ecclesiastical architecture
of Scotland and England may be held to coincide alike in style
and date: the Scottish First-pointed being upon the whole both
earlier and more fully developed than the corresponding English
style, according to the chronology assigned by Mr. Rickman. But
with the first symptoms of transition the ecclesiastical architecture
of Scotland begins to assume its peculiar characteristic features,
marked by a return to the use of the semicircular arch, and a preference
of circular to angular details, employed not indiscriminately
or at random, but on a fixed principle, along with the consistent use
of the pointed arch, and of details peculiar to the later styles. The fact
of such peculiarities is more easily demonstrated than its cause. The
intimacy and interchange of races with England under Malcolm Canmore,
and the complete assimilation of the Church of Scotland to
that of England, abundantly account for the uniformity of the English
and Scottish Romanesque Period. Perhaps we shall not overrate
the effect of the profuse zeal and liberality of David I., and the fruits
of his example, in assuming that the very numerous specimens of
beautiful late Romanesque work, on every scale, from cathedrals and
abbeys, to simple little village churches, built almost entirely in his
reign, may not have been without their influence in stamping some
of its most marked types with an enduring authority on the national
mind&mdash;in all periods of its history characterized by a certain tenacity
of adherence to a favourite idea. Be this, however, as it may, the
retention of the use of the semicircular arch, and of forms of the
same type, after their abandonment in the ecclesiastical architecture
of England, becomes the source of a style peculiar to Scotland, and
which it has been too much the custom hitherto to regard as a mere
provincialism little worthy of note. The worst fruit of this has been,
that our ancient Scottish edifices have been remodelled in accordance
with rules derived entirely from contemporary English models; and
our architects have employed themselves for nearly half a century in
deliberately obliterating the most characteristic features of native art.</p>

<p>The influence which stamped its character on the age of David I.
was more ecclesiastical than civil. The intercourse with England,
though not uninterrupted, continued during his reign and that of his
imbecile successor sufficiently close and frequent to account for much
similarity in the arts and manners of the two kingdoms; nor was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
till the quarrel of William the Lion with Henry II., in 1172, his subsequent
imprisonment, and the disputed claims of independence both
of the Church and Crown, that the effectual alienation took place
from which we may trace in part the divergence of Scottish from
English models. The claim of the dependence of the Scottish Church
on the English archbishops was probably more effectual than any
civil change in severing the two Churches, with all that pertained to
them. But before this lasting disruption took place, the First-pointed
style had been fully developed, and was already expanding into the
rudiments of the next transition. There were indeed constructed, to
some extent contemporaneously, works in what may be correctly
enough styled the Early English, or pure First-pointed style, of
which Glasgow choir is an example, and others like the abbey of
Aberbrothoc, essentially peculiar in many respects. To the latter I
would propose to apply the term, <i>Scottish Geometric</i>, reserving for
the more elaborate style, ultimately developed after the War of Independence,
the name of <i>Scottish Decorated</i>.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> The choir of Glasgow
Cathedral exhibits a series of extremely interesting examples of the
pierced interspaces of the First-pointed window, in which the tracery
of the Decorated Period originated; while the nave of the same
beautiful edifice, the work of Bishop William de Bondington, 1233-1258,
is no less valuable as an example of the succeeding stage,
where the grouped lancet windows have given place to a pointed
arch divided by plain mullions and intersecting tracery into several
lights, which again have in some cases been filled in with geometric
figures, still very partially blended into a homogeneous or consistent
whole. The circular arch, however, was never totally abandoned. In
the chapter-house of the abbey of Inchcolm, for example, a beautiful
little octagonal structure of two floors, the doorway is a semicircular
arch, though with mouldings entirely of the later style; the chapter-house
is lighted with small lancet windows, while the chamber above
has corresponding apertures with semicircular heads. This preference
of the semicircular arch, especially for doorways, was never afterwards
laid aside. The great west entrance of the magnificent abbey of
Aberbrothoc, founded by William the Lion in 1178, is an exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>rich and beautiful Scottish doorway of the period, presenting in its
details the blending of forms derived both from the Romanesque and
First-pointed styles. The entire building furnishes a most interesting
example of the peculiarities of early Scottish Gothic, marking, as
I conceive, the historic epoch in which the native styles had their
rise. In the south transept, for example, this is exhibited with great
freedom and variety of character. Three tiers of arcades decorate the
wall: the lowest consists of a series of equilateral pointed arches,
each filled with a cusped trefoil head, and ranging with and repeating
the same mouldings is a small but finely proportioned semicircular
headed doorway. The arrangement is exceedingly happy, admitting
of the greater breadth of doorway without breaking the line formed
by the top of the arcade, or disturbing the uniformity of its series of
engaged shafts. So far from seeming to be incongruous, it has a
most harmonious effect to the eye. Above this is a second arcade,
composed entirely of the lancet arch; while the third, or highest
tier, consists of a series of semicircular arches, forming the continuation
of the triforium, so that the arrangement of the orders seems
deliberately reversed. The pleasing effect of the whole can only be
judged of when seen <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the arts continued to progress, advancing towards more
complete development of the medieval architecture, then common in
all its most essential features to nearly the whole of Europe. The
Canons of the General Council of the Scottish Church, in 1242, preserve
to us a remarkable ordinance for an annual national collection
throughout the kingdom in aid of the building of Glasgow Cathedral,
the present nave of which was then in progress. The translation of
the relics of St. Margaret to the choir of Dunfermline Abbey, in 1250,
marks the completion of that interesting contemporary work,&mdash;now
unhappily replaced by a pseudo-choir in the style of the year 1820.
Works manifestly of the same period, and more markedly Scottish,
are still common in many districts: as in parts of Dunblane Cathedral,
of Paisley Abbey, Brechin Cathedral, the east end, and other
portions of the Cathedral of the Orkneys, &amp;c. But a great revolution
was at hand, which abruptly severed the already loosening cords
that for a time had brought the ancient kingdoms and the Churches
of Scotland and England into unwonted unity of purpose and feeling.
In 1285 died the wise and good king, Alexander III., leaving his
kingdom to all the miseries of a divided regency and a disputed suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>cession.
Margaret of Norway, granddaughter of Alexander, an infant,
at a foreign court, had been acknowledged the heir to the crown of
Scotland very shortly before the sudden death of the king. Eric,
king of Norway, alarmed at the dissensions among the Scottish
regents, appealed to Edward of England to interpose, and thus commenced
the series of memorable events in our national history,
ending in the war of independence, which placed the Bruce upon the
throne, and finally shut out England from all influence on Scottish
policy or art. Thenceforth to have "an English heart" was the
Scottish name for treason; and the term deliberately applied even in
the Acts of the Scottish Parliament to their southern neighbours is
"our auld enemies of England."</p>

<p>The year 1306, in which Robert Bruce ascended the throne of his
ancestors, almost exactly corresponds with the date (1307) assigned
by Rickman for the close of the First-pointed or Early English style.
But meanwhile a period of division, anarchy, and bloody war, had
lasted in Scotland for upwards of seventy years, during which the
only arts that found encouragement were those of the armourer and
the military architect; nor was this state of things brought to a close
twelve years after the coronation of the Bruce, when, in the year
1318, the Pope, John XXII., the obsequious tool of England, renewed
the excommunication of Clement V. against the king and all his adherents.
The very registers and chartularies are ominously silent;
though here and there we find evidence that the old spirit of pious
largess to the Church was only temporarily overborne by the stern
necessities of the time. Bishops and abbots meanwhile fought alongside
of their fellow-countrymen in the foremost of the fight, or, like
the good Abbot of Inchaffray, animated them to strike for liberty
and independence. The results of all this are abundantly apparent
in the earliest succeeding examples of ecclesiastical architecture.
They partake of the mingled features of the First and Middle-pointed
styles, and are in many cases characterized by a degree of plainness
and meagre simplicity which renders the application of the term
<i>Decorated</i> occasionally very inappropriate to what contain, nevertheless,
the rudiments of the style. What marks them still more with a
novel character are features such as the unusually small side doorways,
the small windows, the single aisle, and, above all, the plain
vault, whether pointed or round, all of which appear to be traceable
to the almost exclusive devotion to military architecture by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
builders of that age. The Church was then <i>militant</i> in a peculiar
sense, and found it difficult to reassume the fitter and more becoming
garb of peace.</p>

<p>The plainest, as well as the most ornate Scottish ecclesiastical
structures subsequent to this date, almost invariably exhibit some
interesting evidence of the adherence to the use of the semicircular
arch, and its cognate forms, not only in doors, windows, and arcades,
but in the tracery of pointed windows, which at length resulted in
the peculiar style of Scottish Decorated Gothic. The Scots, in truth,
did of necessity, and undesignedly, what the modern artists, especially
of Germany, have affirmed in their practice to be indispensable to
the revival of art. They returned nearly to the rudiments of pointed
architecture, and wrought out a system for themselves. From this
date the rules of English ecclesiology can only mislead the student of
Scottish ecclesiastical architecture.</p>

<p>The choir of the singular church of the monastery of Carmelites or
Whitefriars, at South Queensferry, founded by Dundas of Dundas in
1330, is an exceedingly interesting specimen of the simple style of
the period. The windows, which are few and small, divided by plain
mullions, with no other tracery than their bending into lancet and
interspaces in the head; the roof a plain vault without groining, and
with a singularly sombre look from its entire elevation above all the
windows except at the east end, there being no aisles, and consequently
no clere-story; the piscina, on the south side, a recessed
pointed arch, neatly moulded, but without cusping or other ornament;
the sedilia alongside of it, a flat-arched recess, rounded off at
the angles by a segmental curve, and divided into three spaces only
by pendant mouldings or cusps, too imperfect now to shew exactly
what they may have been: all these are characteristic chiefly of the
extreme simplicity of the details. But here also the semicircular
arch occurs. The credence in the east wall, on the north side of the
altar, is recessed with mouldings nearly similar to the piscina, and
like it with all the mouldings sunk within the recess, but with a
rounded instead of a pointed arch. The priest's door, on the south
side of the choir, is of the same form externally, though square-headed
within; and a plain ambry occupies the north wall, directly opposite
to the piscina. The eastern gable of the church is decorated externally
in a novel manner with a niche and various heraldic devices,
probably of later date, and coeval with the nave and south transept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
which are curious specimens of the Perpendicular style.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> This extremely
interesting example of an important period of Scottish
Ecclesiology is generally overlooked, though it lies within a mile of
Dalmeny, the favourite example of the parochial church architecture
of the twelfth century. Its very existence is probably unknown to
thousands who annually pass the neighbouring ferry, as it lies beyond
the route of travellers going to the north.</p>

<p>The little ruined church of the village of Temple, East-Lothian, is
another simple but pleasing specimen of the transition from the First-pointed
to the Scottish Decorated style. Two long, narrow lancet
windows, now blocked up, probably indicate the original character
of the whole structure. The large east window is divided into three
lights by mullions and intersecting tracery in the head, into the two
largest openings of which plain circles are inserted. Still simpler is
the arrangement in the smaller windows on the south side. They are
divided into three lights, the mullions forming pointed heads at the
two side lights; but instead of being continued so as to form intersecting
tracery in the central space, a large circle is inserted between the
pointed heads of the side lights, the lower segment of which finishes the
head of the central light by its inverted curve. In this extremely simple
combination may be traced the rudiments of the beautiful and richly
decorated window in the south transept of Melrose Abbey. The same
mode of filling up the head of the window with circles inserted in the
intersecting tracery, may be seen on a large scale in the two great
windows of the west front of Paisley Abbey, founded by Walter, the
second of the family, Steward of Scotland, about 1163,<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> for monks of
the Cluniac order of reformed Benedictines. It likewise occurs in
some of the original windows of Glasgow Cathedral; while the partial
development of the same simple combinations, into intricate and
beautiful forms is most happily illustrated in the tracery of the south
side of the nave, evidently an insertion of later date than the building,
the north windows of which remain unaltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/image622.jpg" width="303" height="445" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A decorated window in the west gable of Paisley Abbey, belonging
to a period fully a century later than the lower portion of the same
front, exhibits the preference for the circular instead of the ogee arch,
which would have been combined with the other features of its tracery
in any English example of the style. The round-headed light is found
to prevail alike in the plainest and the most ornate tracery, from the
abandonment of the First-pointed style about the middle of the thirteenth
century, till the final close of Scottish medieval ecclesiology in
the troubled reign of James V. The curious but remarkably simple
window figured here is one of the original ones in the nave of the
beautiful little collegiate church of Corstorphine, near Edinburgh,
founded by Sir John Forrester in 1429.
But it is not in such minor features as
tracery heads only that the rounded arch
is employed. Throughout the whole
period from the introduction of the
Scottish geometric Gothic, in the reign
of William the Lion, till the abandonment
of medieval art, it continued to be
used interchangeably with the pointed
arch wherever convenience or taste suggested
its adoption. In the triforium of
Paisley Abbey one of the most remarkable
examples occurs of its use in common
with the later form of arch in
the main features of the architectural design. Corresponding in
breadth to each bay of the nave is a large semicircular arch spring
from short clustered columns, with moulded capitals, nearly resembling
those of the plainer First-pointed pillars of the nave. The rich
mouldings of the triforium arch are recessed to the same depth as the
pointed arches below, and are again subdivided by a slender clustered
column into two pointed and cusped cinquefoil arches, with a quaterfoil
in the space between. A similar arrangement, though executed in a
less ornate style, occurs in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral, the work
of Bishop Robert de Cardeny, 1406,<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> while the practical end in view
may be observed in the nave of Holyrood Abbey, where a constructive
semicircular arch is thrown from pillar to pillar at the same elevation,
though there concealed by the triforium screen. The object in both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>cases obviously was to throw the principal weight upon the supporting
columns of the centre aisle. These examples serve to shew the interchangeable
use of the round and pointed arch by the Scottish architect
as it best suited his purpose, or harmonized with the general arrangements
of his design. So also in the doorways, the clere-story windows,
and the tracery, the rounded arch is systematically used in the Scottish
Decorated period interchangeably with the later pointed forms. But
the taste for rounded forms also manifests itself in other ways: in circular
turret stair-cases, as at Linlithgow, and formerly in that attached
to the beautiful south porch of St. Giles's, Edinburgh; and again in
the vaulted roofs of belfry towers, where the converging ribs meet in
a large open moulded circle, as at St. Giles's, Edinburgh, St. Michael's,
Linlithgow, the collegiate churches of Seton and Torphichen, and till
recently in the rich groining, springing from large half figures of
angels bearing shields and scrolls, of the plain west tower of Glasgow
Cathedral,&mdash;most injudiciously removed to restore the west front to a
uniformity which but poorly repays the idea of size and elevation formerly
conveyed by the contrast between the central and west towers.</p>

<p>Examples of the semicircular-headed doorway are of constant occurrence
throughout the whole Scottish Decorated period, accompanied
with the utmost variety and extent of decoration. The west door of
the Abbey Church, Haddington, is a very pleasing example of two
orders repeating the favourite roll-and-fillet moulding, with a deep
hollow between filled with floriated decoration. It is divided into two
doorways by a central shaft, and both it and the jam-shafts have
richly floriated capitals and moulded bases. The triple, round-headed
windows of the tower, and indeed the whole style of its decoration,
are no less markedly characteristic of the peculiarities of the Scottish
Decorated period. A still more beautiful doorway, of similar construction,
formed, till the year 1829, the entrance to a chapel added
to the south aisle of the collegiate church of St. Giles at Edinburgh
in 1387. It is now rebuilt between two of the pillars of the central
tower, but shorn of many of its finest adjuncts. Similar illustrations
might be greatly multiplied, as in the vestry door of the cathedral at
Iona, filled in with a trefoil arch; in the beautiful cloister doorway of
Melrose Abbey; in the gracefully proportioned priests' door of the collegiate
church of Seton, on the south side of the choir, adorned with
the arms of Sir William Seton on a shield couche, about the year
1400, but more probably the work of his son; who was buried there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
1441; and in the richly decorated south doorway of Holyrood Abbey,
with ogee canopy, and flanking buttresses, the work of Abbot Crawfurd
about 1458. The same form of doorway was to be seen, accompanied
with several varieties of detail, in the collegiate church of the
Holy Trinity at Edinburgh, founded by Mary of Gueldres, the widow
of James II., in 1462, and recklessly demolished in the progress of the
North British Railway operations in 1848. In some respects this
was the finest example of late decorated work in Scotland. The entrance
from the north transept to the chantry chapel, latterly used as
the vestry, was by a neat round-headed doorway, with a simple roll-and-triple-fillet
moulding, with a broad hollow externally running
continuously round the arch, and with a hood-mould enriched with
flowers in the hollow, springing from moulded corbels.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/image624.jpg" width="486" height="528" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another small round-headed doorway, with a similarly decorated
hood moulding, but with engaged jam-shafts with moulded capitals
and bases, latterly blocked up, had formed the entrance to the north
transept; and a large one, of like construction, but with the rich
mouldings in the jams carried round the head of the arch, without
capitals, was placed within a groined porch formed in the angle of
the south transept, and formed the principal entrance to the church.
The decorations of this fine doorway consisted entirely of a series
of filleted quarter-roll mouldings, continued round the recess of the
doorway without any break. The most beautiful portion of the whole
building was the richly decorated
groined roof of the choir
and apse, with its vaulting shafts
springing from corbels sculptured
into all manner of grotesque
forms of imps, grinning masks,
and caricatures of monks and
friars, such as the one here figured,
which projected nearly over the
site of the old high altar, as if in
purposed mockery of the rites on
which it seemed to look down.
Yet above these unseemly drolls
rose the ribbed groins of the
beautiful roof, in its eastern portion especially, hardly to be surpassed
in chaste design or elaborately varied details. In this point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
however, it more nearly approximated to the usual arrangement of English
roofs, being enriched with clustering ribs and bosses, and divided
by transverse pointed arches into vaulted bays. The most striking
peculiarity in the Scottish stone roof-work is the use of the single
vault instead of the transverse groined vaulting, deemed essential elsewhere
to ecclesiastical roofing. In its earliest and simplest forms, as in
the choir at South Queensferry, it differs in no way from the contemporary
baronial halls, as at Borthwick or Crichton, from which it appears
to have been directly derived. It is probable, however, that pictorial
decoration was employed to relieve its otherwise bald surface, as was
certainly the case in the baronial halls, traces of which still remain
both at Borthwick and Craigmillar. It continued in use to the last
in this very simple form, where little decoration was required, as in
the muniment room of the church of the Holy Trinity at Edinburgh,
while the choir of the same building presented one of the chastest
and richest specimens of a groined vault in Scotland.</p>

<p>The single vaulted church roof, so like that of the baronial hall,
may be very fitly traced to the almost exclusive occupation of Scottish
builders, for nearly a century previous to its introduction in
military architecture. But while retaining its form they speedily
learned to restore it to harmony with the decorated work below. The
chapel of St. Mirinus, more frequently termed the sounding aisle,
attached to the south side of Paisley Abbey, furnishes a remarkably
beautiful specimen of a ribbed roof of this simple form, treated with
great variety, and an ingenious adaptation to the variations in the
walls from which it springs, which shews how entirely the architect
was familiar with this style of vaulting, so little known elsewhere.
The choir of the collegiate church of Bothwell, founded by the grim
Earl of Douglas in 1398, is another very fine example, in which the
richness of details abundantly proves that economy had no influence
in the choice of this favourite form of ceiling. Another magnificent
specimen of the richest style of Scottish decorated Gothic is Lincluden
Abbey, the work of the same grim Earl; but its graceful vaulting-shafts
no longer sustain the branching ribs of stone. The choir at
Seton is a plainer and less complete example. Only the eastern portion,
including the apse, is decorated with moulded ribs, which spring
from sculptured corbels, and meet in the ridge rib, where they are
tied by equally fine bosses at the intersections. George, second Lord
Seton, is said by the historian of the house of Seton to have "pendit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
the choir and biggit the vestry," about the year 1493;<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> but the
chronology of this work is manifestly wrong in some places, and is
altogether a very unsafe guide for the ecclesiologist. In nearly all those
examples no side aisles exist, and they are indeed very generally confined
in Scotland to the largest collegiate and abbey churches, being
introduced evidently less for ornament than for use, where an unusual
amount of space was required. Occasionally even the semicircular arch
is employed in the roof, as in the Lady Chapel at Roslin, where the
greater elevation of the pointed arch would be objectionable from its
peculiar position. The choir of the beautiful little cross-church of St.
Monance, Fifeshire, finished apparently in 1369, furnishes an interesting
example of the transition to the transverse vaulted roof, the ridge
ribs of the cross-vaults being bent down about half-way from the centre,
where they diverge from a boss into three groin ribs, the centre one
springing nearly from the top of each window, which is as usual considerably
below the vaulted roof. The choir-roof of the collegiate
church of the Holy Trinity at Edinburgh, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1462, may be considered
as marking the period when the peculiar Scottish vaulted roof
was generally abandoned, though more than one interesting example
of its use at later dates remain to be noticed. It is retained in the
older portion of the north aisle of the choir of St. Giles's Church at
Edinburgh, while the two eastern bays, as well as the beautifully
groined centre aisle, the work of the same period as the collegiate
foundation of Mary of Gueldres, are in conformity with the newer style.</p>

<p>The same convenience which suggested the use of the round instead
of the more elevated pointed arch, also occasionally led to the use of
the still more depressed segmental arch, as in the chantry doorway
at Bothwell; or even to the two-centred flat arch with segmental
curves, as in the great doorway of the beautiful screen and organ-loft
at Glasgow, and in a smaller doorway, the work of Abbot Crawfurd,
circa 1460, now built into the east arch of the north aisle of Holyrood
Abbey. The segmental arch is most frequently employed in monumental
recesses, as at St. Bridget's Douglas, St. Kentigern's Borthwick,
and in the choir at Seton; but other Scottish churches exhibit the
semicircular arch employed for the same purpose, as in the magnificent
tomb of Margaret, countess of Douglas, at Lincluden, and in the
recesses under the great north and south windows of the transepts at
Seton. One of the most beautiful Scottish examples of a late seg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>mental
arched doorway, which is figured here, is that of the vestry
or chantry chapel of Bothwell Church, Lanarkshire.</p>

</div>

<p>The window tracery of the same period, and accompanying the
other features of the Scottish Decorated style already described, partakes
of the like character and forms. The pointed window-head is
subdivided by round-headed lights, and these again are filled in with
foliated details, the result of which is exceedingly pleasing in the
best examples, from the striking contrasts produced by the combination
of pointed and circular forms, as well as from the flowing tracery
frequently resulting from the union of the two, and producing the
pear-shaped light which predominates in Scottish Decorated tracery.
This latter source of expression has led some writers to describe
Scottish tracery as exhibiting an approximation to the French flamboyant
style. Nothing, however, can be more unwarranted. The
ogee form is almost never designedly adopted, and even seems to be
often purposely avoided, as in the Paisley window already cited, and
in many similar examples. The window figured below, from the
south aisle of the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral, is a very characteristic
example of the mode of introducing the circular and semicircular
forms, to modify the ogee tracery lines which so greatly predominate
in the true French flamboyant. The multiplication of descriptions of
minute details of tracery could, however, very partially serve to convey
any distinct idea of the peculiar characteristics of Scottish window
tracery. The woodcut of one of the windows on the south side of the
nave of St. Michael's Church, Linlithgow, may suffice as a characteristic
illustration of the most familiar combinations of the style. Another
though greatly inferior example of the same class of Scottish
Decorated tracery from Melrose, is engraved in the Glossary of Architecture.
(<i>Plate</i> <span class="smcap">CCXLVIII.</span>, vol. iii.) One remarkable Scottish specimen
of ecclesiastical architecture must not be omitted to be noticed, as a
singular instance of the local peculiarities developed by the building
materials of particular districts. The west front of the cathedral of
St. Machar at Old Aberdeen, is chiefly curious as shewing the form
which the style assumed when produced with the intractable granite
of the country. Its erection dates about 1380-1400;<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> but instead of
one large west window, divided by light monials and tracery into nu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>merous
lights, the breadth of front is filled in with a series of tall,
narrow, lancet-like, but round-headed windows, with no other ornament
than a cusped trefoil in the head. The towers on either side are
equally simple and unornate, and are chiefly interesting as genuine
specimens of granite Gothic, of which the modern town exhibits some
more ornate, but greatly less satisfactory examples.</p>

<p>Another peculiar use of the semicircular arch is in clere-story windows,
as in the choir of the remarkable little cathedral of Iona, built
by Abbot Finlay, in the reign of Robert the Bruce, <i>i.e.</i>, prior to 1329;<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
in the nave of Sweetheart Abbey, erected, according to Fordun, in
1275; and in the large collegiate church of St. Michael at Linlithgow,
perhaps added after the conflagration of the church mentioned by Fordun
as occurring in 1424. The latter windows are divided by a neat
mullion into two lights, with trifoliated pointed heads. In this
church may be also noted the occurrence of corby-stepped gables, a
favourite feature of Scottish domestic architecture, occasionally transferred
to ecclesiastical edifices. Interesting examples of the tall,
narrow, round-headed window, occur in the private chapel of the
neighbouring palace. Among the decorations of Linlithgow Church
should also be noted the shields attached to the
columns, and wrought into the bosses of the roof.
These are of frequent occurrence in Scottish
churches. They abound in the beautiful ruin
of Lincluden Abbey; and are also employed in
a peculiar manner as decorations of the capitals
of pillars, where they have frequently an exceedingly
bold effect, as in the eastmost pillars
of St. Giles's choir at Edinburgh, and also in the
Rothesay chapel, in the nave, where large shields,
blazoned with royal and noble arms, project from the cardinal faces of
the abaci, and overhang the lower mouldings of the capital.</p>

</div>

<p>No mention has yet been made of the celebrated collegiate church
of Roslin, founded by William St. Clair, Earl of Caithness, in 1466,
because it has hitherto been usual to regard it as an altogether
unique architectural monstrosity. It will be seen, however, from the
preceding sketch of the most characteristic peculiarities of the Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
Decorated style, that many of the most remarkable features of
Roslin Chapel are derived from the prevailing models of the period,
though carried to an exuberant excess. The circular doorway and
segmental porch, the dark vaulted roof, and much of the window
tracery, are all common to the style. Even the singular arrangement
of its retro-choir, with a clustered pillar terminating the vista
of the centre aisle, is nearly a repetition of that of the cathedral of
St. Mungo at Glasgow. Various portions of other edifices will also be
found to furnish examples of arrangement and details corresponding
with those of Roslin, as in the doorway of the south porch and
other features of St. Michael's, Linlithgow, and also in some parts of
the beautiful ruined church of St. Bridget, Douglas. It is altogether
a mistake to regard the singularly interesting church at Roslin, which
even the critic enjoys while he condemns, as an exotic produced by
foreign skill. Its counterparts will be more easily found in Scotland
than in any other part of Europe. It is a curious fact, worthy of note
in passing, that only twenty-two varieties of mason's marks occur
throughout the whole building, indicating perhaps the number of skilled
workmen to whose elaborate art we owe its intricate and endless
variety of sculptured details. Among these, notwithstanding the
many descriptions and drawings which have been made of the chapel,
it is little known that there exist the remarkable series of medieval
religious allegories&mdash;the seven acts of mercy, the seven deadly sins,
and the dance of death: the latter including at least twenty different
groups and scenes&mdash;as strange a story as was ever told in stone.</p>

<p>From some of the few dates which have been given it will be perceived
that the close of the Scottish Decorated period is as totally
disconnected with that of England as is the development of its peculiar
and most characteristic features. The large collegiate church of
St. Giles at Edinburgh, the cathedral of the bishopric during the
brief period of the existence of the see, exhibited, till its recent
remodelling, a most interesting progressive series of examples of
this style, from its simplest to its latest pure state. The destruction
of so much of this by the misdirected zeal of modern beautifiers is a
source of just regret to the Scottish ecclesiologist, as the dates of
many of the additions were ascertainable, and afforded a safe guide
in tracing out the gradual development of the style. But enough still
remains in the interior to be well worthy of study. The oldest portion
is the north aisle of the choir, with its longitudinal vault, shew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>ing
what was the style of the centre aisle of the nave previous to 1829,
and also of the choir prior to the erection of the present beautiful
clere-story about 1466. The date of the north aisle may not improbably
be yet ascertained precisely; meanwhile, in the absence of such
evidence, its mouldings and other details appear to justify the assignment
of its erection immediately after the burning of the church and
town by Edward III. in 1355. A charter of David II., dated <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1359, confirms under the great seal the endowment of the altar of St.
Catherine there with the upper lands of Merchiston. Like the neighbouring
abbey, however, it was repeatedly spoiled, burned, repaired,
and rebuilt. In the archives of the burgh a contract is still preserved
made in the year 1380 between the Provost and certain masons to
vault over a part of the church,&mdash;probably the simple but fine ribbed
vault of the nave demolished in 1829. A small aisle of two bays,
built between the north transept and a fine late Romanesque porch,&mdash;only
defaced in the latter end of the last century, and finally demolished
in our own day,&mdash;appeared from its style to be of nearly the
same date. The woodcut shews
the singular sculptures on one of
the bosses in the eastern bay,
which appeared from the original
painted glass formerly in its window
to have been the chapel of
St. Eloi, the patron saint of the ancient
corporation of Hammermen.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 503px;">
<img src="images/image631.jpg" width="503" height="455" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1385 the church was again
burned by the army of Richard
II.;<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> and in 1387, as appears by
the agreement with "Johne Johne
of Stone and Johne Skayer, masounys," still preserved among the
city archives, the five chapels were added on the south side of the
nave. One of these included the beautiful porch and doorway already
described, which is required by the contract to be "in als gude maner
als the durre standand in the west gavyl of ye foresaid kyrk."<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> From
this, therefore, we may presume that the great west door&mdash;demolished
as appears from the burgh records, along with the whole west wall in
1561&mdash;was also in the favourite Scottish form of the rounded arch.
Various entries in the accounts of the Great Chamberlain of Scotland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>rendered at the Exchequer between the years 1390 and 1413, shew
that the cost of the restoration of the main building had been borne
by Government, while the city was engaged in extending it by the
addition of a second aisle on the south side of the nave; and to this
period there can be no hesitation in assigning the present south aisle
of the nave,&mdash;closely corresponding in style to the five chapels built
in fulfilment of the contract of 1387. The next addition was a second
aisle added to the north side of the nave, forming two bays to the
west of the ancient Romanesque porch defaced in 1760. This beautiful
little fragment still remains, with its light and elegant clustered
pillar adorned with large blazoned shields on a rich foliated capital,
from which spring the ribs of its groined roof and the arches which
connect it with the adjoining aisle. The heraldic devices on the
shields supply a clue to
the date as well as to the
singularly interesting associations
connected with
this portion of the church,
from which I have given it
the name of the Rothesay
Chapel. They consist of
the arms of Robert Duke of
Albany, second son of Robert
II., and of Archibald
fourth Earl of Douglas,
two Scottish nobles found
acting in concert only on
one other occasion, when
David Duke of Rothesay
was starved to death in
the dungeon of Falkland
Palace, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1401. It
seems only a legitimate
inference to assume that
this chapel may have been
founded by them as an
expiatory offering for that
dark deed, and a chaplain appointed to say masses at its altar for their
own and their victim's souls. A Parliament holden at Holyrood, 16th
May 1402, enacted the solemn farce of examining them as to the
causes of the prince's death, and a public remission was drawn up
under the King's seal, declaring their innocence in terms which
leave no doubt of their guilt.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> It amply accords with the spirit of
the age to find the two perpetrators of this ruthless murder, after
having satisfied the formalities of an earthly tribunal, proceeding to
purchase peace with heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span></p>

<p>The next addition to the Collegiate Church was the Preston aisle,
added to the south side of the choir by William Prestoune of Gortoune
in 1454, agreeably to a charter setting forth the great labour
and charges of his father, "for the gettyn of the arme bane of Saint
Gele&mdash;the quhilk bane he freely left to our moyr Kirk of Saint Gele
of Edinburgh." The curious charter has been repeatedly printed.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
The chaste and highly decorated groining of this portion of the church
shews the progress of the style, which is still farther illustrated by the
beautiful clere-story and east bays of the choir, added about the
year 1462,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> at which time the burgh records furnish evidence of
considerable work being in progress. The latest addition to the
metropolitan church, with the exception of the rebuilding of the
beautiful crown tower in 1648, was the addition of a third aisle of two
bays, in 1513, between the south transept and the porch erected on
the south side of the nave in 1387. This formed a chapel dedicated
to the Virgin Mary and Gabriel the Archangel. It was an example
of great value to the Scottish ecclesiologist, as shewing the adherence
to the Decorated style, and its increasingly elaborate yet chaste
adornment with richly sculptured groining, at that late period, one
hundred and thirty-six years after the date assigned by Rickman for
its abandonment in England. Unhappily only a mutilated fragment
of this most interesting addition to the building survived the operations
of 1829. The favourite and beautiful Scottish crown towers must
also be noted, still preserved in St. Giles's, Edinburgh, King's College,
Aberdeen, and the Tolbooth of Glasgow, but once also surmounting
the towers of St. Michael's, Linlithgow, the Abbey Church of Haddington&mdash;styled
from its beauty the Lamp of the Lothians&mdash;and also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>as seems probable from its appearance, the lofty tower at Dundee.
Nothing could more effectually demonstrate the total freedom of our
native architects from all English influence than this remarkable
disagreement in the chronology of the styles practised in the two
kingdoms; nor must it be forgot that the passion of the previous sovereign,
James III., was for architecture, and that his favourite councillor
and companion was his architect, Cochrane, who fell a victim to
the jealousy of the rude Scottish barons, excited by the marks of royal
favour he received. In no country of Europe was architecture more
zealously encouraged than in Scotland during his reign. Our Scottish
poet Drummond somewhat quaintly sums up his character in terms
more censorious than might have been expected from his own dalliance
with the muses: "He was much given to buildings and trimming
up of chapels, halls, and gardens, as usually are the lovers of
idleness; and the rarest frames of churches and palaces in Scotland
were mostly raised about his time: an humour, which though it be
allowable in men which have not much to do, yet it is harmful in
princes."<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> There was still less need to go to foreign sources for instruction
or for artistic models during the prosperous reign of James
IV., the favourer of learning and the arts; the patron of our greatest
national poets, Dunbar, Kennedy, Gawn Douglas, and others of the
Scottish Makars; of Chepman the introducer of the Scottish printing-press;
and indeed the encourager of all the most liberal pursuits of a
chivalrous age. Under his more popular rule, architecture was encouraged
no less royally than in that of his father, and excited the
Scottish nobles to emulation instead of jealousy.</p>

<p>Dunbar's noble poem of the <span class="smcap">Thrissill AND THE Rois</span> commemorates
the reunion of Scotland and England in the affiancing of James IV.
to the Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. of England in 1501;
and it is curious to note how completely coincident with this is the
manifestation of the influence of English models on the contemporary
architecture of Scotland. The Perpendicular or Third-pointed English
style appears in Scotland as a mere exotic, too temporarily tried to
be properly regarded as a national style, and when used at all, employed
contemporaneously with the pure native Decorated work.
The earliest, and if I mistake not the only entire example of a Third-pointed
building in Scotland is the parish church of Ladykirk, on the
banks of the Tweed, built by James IV. in the year 1500. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
a somewhat stiff and formal structure externally, betraying the introduction
of an unfamiliar style. In the interior, however, the features
of the older native models predominate, and the plain single vaulted
arch is especially remarkable in connexion with other details of a
style which was wont in the hands of the southern architect to expend
its utmost exuberance in pendants, bosses, and fan-tracery on the
groined roof. The magnificent perpendicular work of the eastern
portions of Melrose Abbey, however, exhibit no such formality or
plainness, though probably a nearly contemporary structure. The
arms of Andrew Hunter, abbot of Melrose, prior to 1453, are cut on
one of the buttresses of the Decorated nave. John Fraser, a later
abbot, promoted from Melrose to the see of Ross in 1485, completed
the cathedral at Fortrose; the pure and elaborate Decorated work of
which admits of no unfavourable comparison with Melrose nave, and
shews that we must look to a later date, and most probably to the following
century, for the introduction of perpendicular details in the
completion of its choir. In the valuable little fragment of the roof of
the latter, fortunately still standing, where all else is gone, we once
more see the influence of Scottish taste modifying the characteristics
of the new style. Here too, instead of the fan-tracery and pendants
of contemporary English roofs, is the Scottish single vault, enriched
only with additional ribs and bosses, but preserving the favourite
feature of carrying the roof completely above the side lights, and
making it depend for illumination upon the great east window. The
few other examples of Scottish perpendicular work which exist are
scarcely sufficient to admit of any general deductions. The semi-hexagonal
apse, both at Linlithgow and Stirling, shew it modified at
a later date by native peculiarities, derived from the favourite Decorated
style, and in the latter&mdash;ascribed to Cardinal Beaton&mdash;also exhibiting
a singular introduction of the round-headed lights of the
earlier period, into the tracery of large perpendicular windows, as well
as a peculiar adaptation of the Scottish vaulted roof. Both, however,
must be regarded as late and somewhat debased examples. Along
with these may also be noted the occasional use of the square-headed
window, as in the chantry chapel of the church of the Holy Trinity
at Edinburgh, and in the clere-story of St. Mary's at Leith, both destroyed
within the last few years. The singular church at South
Queensferry furnishes a very curious example of some of the features of
perpendicular Gothic applied in a novel fashion to an ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
edifice. The north wall appears to have been almost entirely occupied
by the buildings of the monastery, so that it is destitute of ornament,
and only pierced with one small pointed window of one light at the
east end of the choir, near to which a round-headed door&mdash;now
blocked up&mdash;has communicated with the attached buildings. There
is no indication of a north transept having ever existed. Both the
nave and south transept are entirely lighted with square-headed
windows. That of the transept is divided into three lights, neatly
cusped in the head. The west end of the nave is furnished with a
window in the same style, while the door, which is small and plain,
is at the west end of the south side; two other square-headed windows
of two lights fill up this side of the nave, and a large and heavy
rectangular tower, measuring in greatest breadth, from north to south,
across the length of the church, occupies the intersection of the transept
with the nave and choir. Altogether the church is more curious
than admirable as a late specimen of Scottish medieval art.</p>

<p>While this transient attempt at the naturalization of the English Tudor
style of architecture in Scottish art has thus left some few enduring
traces, it is worthy of note that its most characteristic feature, the
four-centred arch, is nearly, if not quite unknown in Scotland, otherwise
than as a modern exotic which figures in the favourite perpendicular
rifacciamentos of ecclesiastical facades, wedded too often to
the bald church or meeting-house with about as much congruity as
the ill-assorted pair that figure in Hogarth's well-known wedding
scene. Whatever might have resulted under more favourable circumstances,
the new style was destined to no full development in
Scotland. By a charter dated 1st August 1513, Walter Chepman,
burgess of Edinburgh, memorable as the introducer of the printing-press
to Scotland, founded and endowed an altar in the south transept,
or "Holy Blood Aisle" of St. Giles's Church, "in honour of
God, the Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist, and all saints." It
was a period of national happiness and prosperity, in which learning
and the arts met with the most ample encouragement. Only one
brief month thereafter all this was at an end. James and the
chief of his nobles lay dead on Flodden Field; Scotland was at the
mercy of Henry VIII.; the Crown devolved to an infant; and
faction, ignorance, and bigotry replaced all the advantages of the
wise and beneficent rule of James IV. It is not by slow degrees,
but abruptly, like the unfinished page of a mutilated chronicle, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
the history of Scottish medieval art comes to an end. Yet the
favourite forms and mouldings of the
Decorated Period lingered long after
in the domestic architecture of the
country. The ornamental ambries
found in the castellated mansions,
and even in the wealthier burghal
dwellings of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, partake so much of
the character of earlier ecclesiastical
features, that they are frequently described
as fonts, stoups, or piscinæ;
and even when standing, as is their
usual wont, by the side of the huge
old fashioned fire-place, they have been assumed to afford evidence
that the domestic halls and kitchens of our ancestors were their
chapels or baptistries. Some few of these relics of obsolete tastes
and manners still linger about the old closes of Edinburgh, though
now rapidly disappearing before the ruthless strides of modern innovation.
The vignette shews the form of one of these ornamental
ambries from a singular antique
mansion in the Old Town of
Edinburgh, which bore the date
1557, and was believed to have
been occupied for a time as the
residence of the Queen Regent,
Mary of Guise. Another large
chamber in the same building
bore evidence of having been at
one time used as a private oratory,
and in it was a curious
and still more highly decorated
niche, which, however, exhibited
somewhat of the debased excesses
pertaining to that closing
period in which the pure Gothic passed into the picturesque but lawless
style of the Elizabethan age. Nevertheless its pierced stone-work
served to illustrate the lingering adherence to the earlier national
style of window-tracery far down into the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Into the characteristics of the later baronial and domestic architecture
of Scotland it is impossible to enter here, though some of
their peculiarities well merit the increased degree of attention they
are now receiving. The picturesqueness of the turret stairs, with
their lintels decorated with monograms and armorial
bearings, and inscribed with quaint legends and pious
mottos; the crow-stepped gables, finials, and dormer
windows, and the singular overhanging carved "timber
lands" of the old streets and closes of Edinburgh,
are familiar to all. Some of their features might still be borrowed
with advantage to our modern street architecture; but for the most
part they are only valuable as the memorials of a period and state
of society which has for ever passed away.</p>

<p>Before quitting the interesting subject of medieval architecture as
developed in Scotland, some notice of the ancient and mysterious
fraternity of Free Masons seems necessary in order to embrace one
important source of that singular progressive unity of purpose traceable
throughout the various stages of medieval ecclesiology. While
Free Masonry was denounced in many countries of Europe, and was
placed for a time under the ban of the law by Henry VI. of England,
its chief protector, it appears to have met with no check or restraint
in Scotland; and having been made the subject of special royal
favour by James I., it has ever since continued to be cherished here
with greater zeal than in almost any other country of Christendom.
With its modern existence, however, apart from the practice of the
art, we have here as little to do as with its extravagant claims to an
antiquity nearly coeval with the art of building. We can trace the
association of masons into guilds or corporations in some parts of
Europe at the very dawn of medieval art. In Lombardy such a free
guild of masons was established in the tenth century; and the craft
is believed to have first obtained footing in England under the Saxon
king, Athelstane, about the same period.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> In Normandy we only
discover the rise of such an association in the middle of the twelfth
century; but the practice of secret combination obviously emanated
from an ecclesiastical source. The whole system of guilds originated,
in part at least, in the necessity of preserving and extending such
speculative and practical knowledge as may now be safely committed
to the press. Such a security for the safe keeping of traditional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>knowledge was specially required in regard to architecture, which
depends so entirely on combined operations, and needs the assistance
of the chief branches of science which were carried to any perfection
during that period. The whole decorative arts of the medieval era
were subordinate to architecture, and it was essentially the handmaid
of the Church. Ecclesiastics were at once its patrons and the chief
practisers of its highest branches, so that the establishment of an
order which embraced within its fellowship all the practical artificers
as naturally sprung from the requirements of the Church as its various
monastic fraternities. Hence, wherever any great ecclesiastical
work was to be carried on, a guild of masons was organized, which no
doubt soon embraced practitioners of every requisite branch of art.
Accordingly we still find in Scotland that the oldest masonic lodges
are at Dunfermline, Elgin, Melrose, Kilwinning, Arbroath, Glasgow,
and other sites of remarkable early ecclesiastical edifices, while generally
some parish churches or other minor ecclesiastical edifices still
exist within the surrounding district, betraying traces of the same
workmanship as the parent edifice. To the oneness of belief by
which medieval Christendom was held together under its common
head, and to the practical unity of the ecclesiastical corporation
which constituted the Church, apart from the laity, may be traced
the rise and gradual development of the successive styles of Gothic
architecture. But to the operations of the masonic lodges within
their several districts must be ascribed the local peculiarities and
provincialisms which may be detected grouping around almost every
great abbey or other remarkable ecclesiastical structure. The geographical
and political isolation of Scotland, which gave to its Church
a degree of independence unknown to most other countries of Papal
Christendom, as well as its very partial share in the great movements
of medieval Europe, including the crusades, all tended to give additional
importance to those local influences which in other countries
were more subordinated by external sources of change. To this source,
therefore, we can hardly err in referring much of the peculiar character
ascribable to Scottish Ecclesiology, which it is attempted here
to reduce to some system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The revived interest in the study of medieval architecture, added
to the happy substitution of investigation for the older and more
convenient practice of theorizing, have led to considerable attention
being directed to the singular marks or symbols, apparently the
works of the original builders, which are observable on all ancient
churches. That masons' marks are old as the building of the
Pyramids is undoubted. They were discovered by Colonel Howard
Vyse on forcing his way into the chambers of construction of the
great pyramid, where there cannot be a doubt no human being had
been before since the completion of its vast masonry. Similar marks
have also been observed on Roman altars and on structures of an
equally early era. The most, however, that can now be inferred from
such is the invariable practice of each workman marking the stone he
had cut, which remains in use in our own day to distinguish the work
of different individuals. But much more than this appears to be deducible
from the medieval masons' marks. "The fact that in these
buildings it is only a certain number of the stones which bear symbols;
that the marks found in different countries (although the
variety is great) are in many cases identical, and in all have a singular
accordance in character, seems to shew that the men who employed
them did so by system, and that the system, if not the same
in England, Germany, and France, was closely analogous in one
country to that of the others."<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The observation and collation of
these marks have accordingly become objects of interest, as calculated
to aid in the elucidation of the history of the medieval masonic
guilds. It is not, however, sufficient merely to detect the occasional
identity of single mason-marks on different and widely distant buildings.
The following, for example, includes, I believe, the entire set
of mason-marks to be found on Roslin Chapel. Of these the first,
&#916;, is only to be found on the altars and piscinæ, and the two adjoining
ones around the doors. A comparison of these with the mason-marks
of Gloucester Cathedral, Malmsbury Abbey Church, Furness
Abbey, &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> will shew that several of the symbols are common to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>all these; but this can lead to no conclusion. Many of the subordinate
lines added to regular figures are still recognised among the craft
as additions given to distinguish the symbols of two masons when the
mark of a member admitted from another lodge was the same as that
already borne by one of their own number. If, however, the entire
series, or the greater number of the marks on one building could be
detected on another apparently of the same age, it would be such
a coincidence as could hardly be ascribed to any other cause than
that both were the work of the same masonic lodge. I should anticipate,
for example, that such would be found to be the case, to some
considerable extent, on the oldest portions of Dunfermline and Lindisfarne
Abbeys, and Durham Cathedral. The united cooperation of
a very few zealous labourers may soon bring such a question to the
test, if sufficient care is taken to discriminate between the original
work and the additions or alterations of subsequent builders. Meanwhile,
when so much zeal is displayed in the collection of Roman
potters' stamps, medieval pilgrims' signs, tradesmen's and tavern
tokens of the seventeenth century, and even the more recent provincial
copper coinage, it may suffice to suggest that the collection of
complete sets of mason-marks from ecclesiastical edifices,&mdash;discriminating
those belonging to portions of different dates,&mdash;may furnish a
clue to the influence of masonic guilds on the development of successive
styles, or the prevalence of remarkable provincial peculiarities.</p>

<p>We obtain from Father Hay's "Genealogie of the Sainte Claires of
Rosslyn," a curious account of the assembling of the needful band of
artificers for the building of the collegiate church founded by William
Saint Clair, Earl of Caithness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His adge creeping on him," says the genealogist, "to the end he might not
seem altogither unthankfull to God for the benefices he receaved from him, it
came in his minde to build a house for God's service, of most curious worke, the
which that it might be done with greater glory and splendor, he caused artificers
to be brought from other regions and forraigne kingdomes, and caused dayly to be
abundance of all kinde of workemen present: as masons, carpenters, smiths, barrowmen,
and quarriers, with others; for it is remembered that for the space of
thirty-four years before, he never wanted great numbers of such workmen. The
foundation of this rare worke he caused to be laid in the year of our Lord 1446;
and to the end the worke might be the more rare: first he caused the draughts to
be drawn upon Eastland boords, and made the carpenters to carve them according
to the draughts thereon, and then gave them for patterns to the massons, that
they might thereby cut the like in stone.... He rewarded the massones according
to their degree."&mdash;Genealogie of the Sainte Claires of Rosslyn, p. 26.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span></p>

<p>From this curious notice it would seem that the Earl was himself
the chief designer and architect to whose ingenuity and inventive
skill we owe the remarkable and unique example of masonic art which
still remains at Roslin. Nor is this at all improbable. He was devoted
to building, in an age in which it became one of the most
favourite pastimes, and indeed engrossing pursuits of the Scottish
kings. The Saint Clairs continued, according to some authorities,
from this early date to be recognised as the chiefs of the whole body
of Scottish Free Masons, till in 1736 William St. Clair, Esq. of Rosslyn,
resigned into the hands of the Scottish lodges the hereditary
office of Grand Master, which, however, he continued to hold till his
death. The evidence of the creation of this office in the person of
the founder of the collegiate church of Roslin is defective, and the
entire narrative of Father Hay must be received with caution, though
professedly derived from original manuscripts. Of the existence, however,
of the hereditary office of Grand Master in the younger branch
of the St. Clairs, which terminated on the death of William St. Clair
of Rosslyn in 1778, there can be no question; and of the early connexion
of the St. Clairs with the masonic fraternity, there seems equally
little reason to doubt. On this account, therefore, the set of mason-marks
given above from the remarkable memorial of their masonic
skill which still exists at Roslin, possesses peculiar interest. While,
however, we find in Father Hay's curious notice that artificers were
brought from foreign kingdoms, that is not to be misunderstood as
indicating that either the design or entire execution of this remarkable
edifice is to be ascribed to a foreign guild. The same was done
by Wykeham, in order to secure the perfect execution of his own
magnificent designs, and in one or two of the mason-marks the additions
may be traced which probably indicate the admission of a
stranger using, <i>with a difference</i>, the symbol already belonging to
some brother of the local guild. The very small number of varieties,
however, is remarkable, though it of course only embraces one class of
the numerous artificers employed. The conclusions indicated by the
traditions of the craft, and the direct evidence which their works
supply, seem equally opposed to the ideas too hastily adopted by some
enthusiastic elucidators of medieval free masonry, that travelling
lodges continued to perambulate Europe, devoting their artistic skill
to supply the wants of the universal church, so that we might look for
precisely the same details being repeated in contemporary works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
the Norman architects of Sicily and of the Orkney Islands, or of
Drontheim. We do indeed find in the eighth century the Pictish
king sending for builders to rear a fitting edifice at Abernethy after
the Roman manner, and, to the last, skilled artificers were doubtless
sought far and near&mdash;with the ready facilities for foreign correspondence
which the Church then exclusively possessed&mdash;whenever any
work of unusual importance was to be executed; but long before the
sons of St. Margaret had commenced their magnificent foundations,
the corresponding demands for the aid of the free mason in every
country of Christendom had removed all necessity for the maintenance
of peripatetic missionary guilds. The order, however, flourished under
this abundant patronage; nor did the localization of its guilds interrupt
that mutual recognition of members of the privileged fraternity
by means of which Gothic architecture continued for upwards of four
hundred years to be a living art, expanding and developing itself
under ever varying but progressive forms of fitness and beauty.</p>

<p>We have witnessed in our own day an attempt to resuscitate medieval
architecture by a retrogression altogether opposed to the spirit
of the old builders, in whose hands it grew like a thing of life that
returns not upon the work of earlier years. Its results have been of
value in securing the restoration of many crumbling memorials of the
past; and in Scotland our best architects have yet much to learn in
the same reverent spirit, ere we can hope to see our national historic
monuments of medieval art preserved, instead of being defaced and
obliterated by the superinduction of spurious French or Anglo-Gothic
details&mdash;a restoration that "means the most total destruction which
a building can suffer; a destruction accompanied with false description
of the thing destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> But a national style of architecture
was never reproduced by such means. It must grow up like the oak,
unforced and in its native soil; and, when thus originating, its living
forms become the embodiment of the polity, social history, and religious
faith of the nation. Yet architecture is on this very account essentially
a practical art, and even in the most gorgeous medieval cathedral a
sense of fitness, and ideas of direct utility, may be traced as controlling
powers influencing the whole design. From this overruling utilitarian
spirit sprang the element of picturesqueness, which we look for in
vain in modern Gothic. The old cathedral or abbey has here a chapter-house,
there a transept or cloister, a chantry chapel, vestry, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>porch, introduced simply because it was required, though harmonized
with all the skill of a perfect artist into an integral part of the architectural
design. In the modern Gothic everything is balanced, proportioned,
and reduced to strict rule and formality, but it is lifeless as
the men of the old centuries to which it properly belongs. As to
modern Protestant cathedrals, with "long-drawn aisles," constructed
for no possible end connected with the worship for which they profess
to be designed, they are manifest absurdities, which proclaim the
lifelessness of the art in which they have originated. The national
peculiarities traceable in medieval architecture are among the most
remarkable evidences that it was a living art. Like a transplanted
flower, it was modified everywhere by the soil and climate: the classic
elements which are seen pervading that of Italy; the substantial yet
ornate but impure grandeur of that of Spain; the compact, consistent,
harmonious completeness of that of Germany; the rich but lawless
exuberance of the French Flamboyant; the stately progression of the
beautiful English Decorated into the profusely overlaid, yet still
strictly defined Perpendicular; and the massive but comparatively
plain and unchanging Scottish Decorated&mdash;all manifest peculiarities
which pertain to the several nations with which they originated. "The
essential modifications of architecture in each age and country must
depend in part on the natural materials, localities, and in part on the
artificial forms, social, civil, and religious, on the acquired habits and
manners of the peculiar nation for which it labours, and the changes
in these must produce corresponding variations in architecture."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
The revivalist who seeks to reproduce the creations of the past in
defiance of these manifest laws by which they existed in harmony
and just adaptation to their geographical or social adjuncts, will find
his self-imposed task not much less hopeless than to reanimate the
fossil Mastodon or Dinotherium. But meanwhile the geologist, without
seeking to reanimate these extinct vertebrata, learns much regarding
the past from the investigation of their colossal remains, and
so too may the archæologist see into the living spirit of the medieval
era by the earnest study of its creations, though he hopes better
things of his own age than that it should expect perfection in those
immature centuries, or seek for life in the beautiful sepulchres wherein
they lie entombed.</p>

<p>The consecutive view given above of the progressive development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
of the various styles of ecclesiastical architecture, accompanied as it
is with some few elements for the construction of a chronological
series of examples, is sufficient, at least, to bear out the views advanced
in reference to the independent character and individuality
of Scottish Ecclesiology. It would be easy to multiply references to
examples of the various peculiar features referred to, but what is far
more wanted is the ascertainment of a larger number of well authenticated
dates of existing work. Even of the cathedrals and great
abbeys scarcely anything is known, though now that so many of the
Scottish chartularies are published, and as a valuable adjunct to
them, their seals are being systematically described, we may hope to
discover, by a comparison with the armorial sculpture of our ecclesiastical
structures, a sufficient number of dated examples by which
to test the whole. Meanwhile, the following table is offered with great
diffidence, and merely as some probable approximation to the true
chronological arrangement of the Scottish styles, placing alongside of
it the English classification of Rickman, as adopted with some later
modifications, in the Fifth Edition of the Glossary of Architecture, to
shew the extent of coincidence or disagreement. I shall be glad to
find it speedily superseded by a system much more complete; but
anything which supplies the elements of a recognised nomenclature
and orderly classification will be of some use as a help towards cooperation
among Scottish ecclesiologists. The styles distinguished
here as <i>First-pointed</i> and <i>Geometric</i> are to some extent synchronous,
depending perhaps on the native or foreign education of the ecclesiastics
by whom the works were prosecuted;&mdash;a remarkable circumstance,
and probably without a parallel in the history of medieval art.
We find William de Bondington of Glasgow, for example, in the last
year of his episcopate, adopting the ritual and customs of Sarum as the
constitution of his cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> It need not therefore excite our surprise
to find the portion of the nave executed under his superintendence
bearing an equally close affinity to the Sarum model, then in
progress. Scottish First-pointed differs very little from the Early
English, whereas the Scottish Geometric has no parallel elsewhere,
and in Scotland entirely superseded the other at a very early date.
It is, therefore, manifestly indispensable to the prosecution of Scottish
Ecclesiology, that what is peculiar to it shall receive a nomenclature
of its own. It can only lead to uncertainty and confusion to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>continue to apply the term First-pointed<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> to such work as the east
end of St. Magnus's Cathedral, where not only the pier and triforium
arches are semicircular, but even the arch of the great east window is
filled in with a rose of twelve leaves, and being left unpierced above,
it is practically a round-headed light. A much more elaborate treatment
of the subject would be necessary than is possible within the
limits of a single chapter, in order to shew the peculiar mouldings
and other characteristic details. In the Scottish Decorated, for example,
cylindrical and octagonal piers are by no means uncommon;
both pier arches and windows are very frequently composed simply
of two or three plain chamfer orders. Square-edged hood-mouldings
and string-courses are also common; and in the more ornamental
piers the double-roll, and the roll and fillet mouldings almost invariably
predominate. In the windows also&mdash;among the most expressive
features of every style of Gothic architecture&mdash;one harmonious feeling
is observable throughout the endless varieties of tracery, giving to
them a national aspect not less marked than the physiognomy of their
builders. The most prevailing characteristics are well represented in
the example figured above, from one of the beautiful series of St.
Michael's, Linlithgow. Similar windows, though varying in detail,
occur at St. Monance, Fife, St. Mary's, Leith, at Mid-Calder and
Duddingston, in the Abbey Church, Haddington, in the collegiate
churches of Seton, Crichton, and Roslin, in Melrose Abbey, and the
ancient church tower of Dundee. They also existed in both the collegiate
churches of St. Giles and the Holy Trinity at Edinburgh; and
are even found amid the traces of declining art in the beautiful
chapels of King's College, Aberdeen, and Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh&mdash;the
latter of which has been assigned, without a shadow of
evidence, as the work of Inigo Jones, the architect having in reality
been William Wallace, styled in the treasurer's accounts and other
authentic documents relating to its erection, by the old name of
Master Mason. Such are some of the genuine characteristics of our
native styles; but at Dunfermline, Dunblane, Corstorphine, or
wherever the hand of the modern restorer has been, we find them
displaced by perpendicular tracery, English mouldings and details,
and the like evidences of irreverent ignorance.</p>

on the kindness of a local correspondent
for the description of its present state. It
appears to be early and exceedingly plain
Romanesque work, with some later and

the newer English nomenclature to characterize
the Romanesque as <i>First-round</i>,
the succeeding style as First-pointed; and
then the Scottish style resulting from the
two, as <i>Second-round</i>; and the peculiarly
national style into which it was finally developed

English ecclesiologists may answer their
native style, it is impossible to adapt it to
Scotland. First-pointed is undoubtedly
preferable to Early English, when we can
shew still earlier Scottish. Middle-pointed,
however, is a most inconvenient and unsuitable
term to our Scottish Decorated, where
many of its most characteristic forms are
circular; and Third-pointed becomes a misnomer,
where, as in the nave and transept
of South Queensferry the only pointed arch
is a small plain benatura on the east side of
the door, which is placed on the south side
of the nave. The windows are square-headed,
and the door round-headed. The
roof has been open timber work.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

ECCLESIASTICAL ANTIQUITIES.</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding the systematic eradication of every relic associated
with the rites or dogmas of the old faith, carried on by the
Scottish Reformers of the sixteenth century, ecclesiastical remains
are still preserved in sufficient number to furnish out a much ampler
list than the limits of this work can embrace. The recumbent effigy,
for example, is to be met with in many districts of Scotland, sometimes
mutilated and defaced, but not unfrequently still exhibiting
evidences of refined taste and delicacy of manipulation pertaining
to the best epoch of medieval art. Perhaps no work of the period
is more characteristic of the change from the age of the tumulus
builders than the recumbent effigy of the Christian knight. It is one
of the most significant memorials of the mild influences of a purer
faith on the arts and sepulchral rites of the race. The armour and
weapons of war are indeed still there, but the sword is in its sheath;
the position is that of repose; and not unfrequently the hands are
clasped in the attitude of devotion, the symbol of prayer. The majority
of these medieval monuments belong to the fifteenth century,
and some of those which occur in Iona and the Hebrides are altogether
peculiar in costume and style of art. There is little, however, to
distinguish the greater number of the Scottish from the English recumbent
effigies, unless one peculiarity be worth noting, seemingly
characteristic of a national luxuriousness which is little applicable to
the rude barons of the Scottish middle ages. The crested tilting
helmet, which is the most frequent pillow of the recumbent English
knight, is of rare occurrence in Scotland, being more generally re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>placed
by a richly sculptured cushion. It is needless, however, to
multiply illustrations of a point involving no more than a conventional
formula of art.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Sepulchral brasses, though now almost unknown
in Scotland, may once have been little less abundant than the
recumbent effigy. The "Oxford Manual" mentions only one, that of
the Stuarts of Minto, in the nave of Glasgow Cathedral; bearing the
date 1605. To this solitary example, however, one or two additions
can still be made. The "restorations" of the collegiate church of
St. Giles at Edinburgh in 1829, compassed, among other lamentable
defacements, the destruction of the tomb of "The Good Regent," including
the brass engraved with the figures of Justice and Faith, and
the epitaph from the pen of George Buchanan.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The brass has fortunately
been rescued, and is preserved in the possession of the Hon.
John Stuart, one of the lineal descendants of the Regent, James
Earl of Moray, by whom steps have been recently taken with a view
to its restoration. A charter granted by the city of Edinburgh to
William Preston of Gortoun, in 1454, in acknowledgment of his father's
invaluable gift of "the arme bane of Saint Gele," preserves the record
of at least one other brass that once adorned the same ancient church,
though long since gone, with so many other of its most interesting
features. It is described as "a plate of brase, with a writ specifiand
the bringing of that relik be him in Scotland, with his armis." A
small mural brass still remains in part of the church of St. Nicholas,
Aberdeen, known as Drum's Aisle, bearing two shields of arms&mdash;the
one bearing the three banded bunches of holly leaves for Irvine; and
the other three pales for Keith. It surmounted the recumbent effigy
of Alexander Irvine, third of the ancient family of Drum, who fell at
the battle of Harlaw in the year 1411, and of his wife Elizabeth Keith,
daughter of the Lord Robert de Keith. The knight is in full armour,
but crowned with a chaplet of flowers, and his feet resting on a lion;
while the lady's feet are supported by a dog. The monument has
obviously been executed during their lifetimes, from the blanks
still remaining on the brass, which tell, amid all the pomp of these
anticipatory sepulchral honours, that no pious hand was found
to grave the few simple additions requisite to have made of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>dumb tablet a true memorial of the dead. The imperfect inscriptions
are,&mdash;</p>

<p>Principal Gordon, of the Scots College, Paris, describes in his
"Remarks on a Journey to the Orkney Islands," made in 1781, the
monument of Bishop Tulloch, the brass of which&mdash;"a plate of copper
full length of the grave"&mdash;was carried off by a party of Cromwell's
soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> More recent plunderers have removed, within the last
twenty years, a brass which had escaped the hands of previous devastators
of the monastery of Inchcolm, in the Frith of Forth. Nor
is it altogether impossible that others may even now remain safe
under the protection of more modern flooring, or superincumbent
debris. The floor of St. Mary's Church at Leith was removed in the
course of extensive alterations effected on it in 1848, and was found
to cover the original paving with inscriptions and armorial shields of
early date. On the repair and reseating of Whitekirk parish church,
East-Lothian, a few years since, a large stone slab, which now lies
in the adjoining churchyard, was removed from its original site in
the chancel, and disclosed a remarkably fine matrix of what appears
to have been the full sized figure of an ecclesiastic, with canopy and
surrounding inscription. Similar matrices are even now by no means
rare. One of large size lies in the barn-yard of the Abbey Farm, in
the vicinity of the ruins of North-Berwick Abbey. Another has been
recently exposed within the area of the nave of Seton Church, East-Lothian.
Others are to be seen at Aberbrothoc, Dunfermline, and
Dunblane, the last exhibiting traces of a large ornamental cross. One
of unusual dimensions, which lies in the chancel of the cathedral
of Iona, is traditionally assigned to Macleod of Macleod. The representation
of the full length figure of a knight in armour may still
be traced, with his sword by his side, and his feet resting on some
animal. It has been surrounded with an inscription on an orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>mental
border, and tradition adds, was completed by a plate, not of
brass but of silver.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>Incised slabs are still more common. Some of those at Iona especially
are characterized by peculiar beauty and great variety of design.
Nearly the whole of the north and south aisles of the nave of Holyrood
Abbey are also still paved with incised slabs, including those of
various ecclesiastics, engraved with floriated or Calvary cross, and
generally with the paten and chalice on each side, or with the chalice
only, resting on the long limb of the cross. Roslin Chapel has a
curious example of an incised monumental slab, representing a knight
in full armour. In the church of Kinkill, Aberdeenshire, Sir Robert
Scrimgeour, high constable of Dundee, who fell at the battle of Harlaw
in 1411, is similarly portrayed at full length; and in the south
aisle of the church of Foveran, in the same county, two knights in
complete armour are represented on one slab, under an ornamental
canopy. Examples also occur at Dalmally and other ancient ecclesiastical
sites in Argyleshire and the Western Islands, but these are
sufficient to illustrate this class of medieval sepulchral memorials.</p>

<p>Stone coffins are no less abundant, but also rarely marked by any
peculiar features; the later Scottish sepulchral rites being no doubt
for the most part such as were common to medieval Europe. One of
the most interesting discoveries of this class was made during recent
repairs of the nave of Dunfermline Abbey. In the centre of the nave,
towards its east end, a stone coffin of the form and dimensions of
those of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was found under
the paving. On removing the lid it disclosed a singular leathern
shroud, which remained in good preservation, although the body it
was intended to protect had long mouldered into dust. The prepared
leathern skin is double, and has been wrapped entirely round
the body, like the bandages of a mummy; it is laced across the
breast, and stitched with a strong leathern thong entirely up the back
from the neck to the heels, and along the soles of the feet. It has
been removed to the Dunfermline Museum, where it is preserved suspended
in a glass case&mdash;in some respects a more eloquent <i>memento</i>
<i>mori</i> than the Egyptian's "imperishable type of evanescence:" a
shroud which has escaped the mortality of the corpse within its folds.
The coffin has been assigned by local antiquaries as that of Edward, the
eldest son of Malcolm Canmore; but there is no evidence to justify
multiplies the evil tenfold, the Rev. J. S. Howson, on comparing it
with the numerous sculptured crosses of the district, so faithfully described
by him in the Cambridge Camden Society's Transactions,
and finding that "the scroll-work on the bell-case, and the figure of
our Saviour, are closely similar to the corresponding representations
on the Argyleshire crosses," jumps to the conclusion that they also
must needs be Scandinavian.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> The very opposite conclusion would
seem unavoidable, were it not that this idea of the supremacy of
Scandinavian art in Scotland has superseded reasoning, and maintains
its ground in defiance of evidence. History leaves no room to doubt
that the Scandinavian invaders devastated and destroyed many native
works, and greatly retarded the full development of the arts of civilisation
of the Scottish Christian era. Scottish antiquaries certainly display
a truly forgiving spirit in crediting them with the invention of
what little escaped their sacrilegious ravages. I cannot avoid characterizing
the supplementary observations on the Kilmichael-Glassrie
bell-shrine in the Archæologia Scotica, which have furnished the basis
of the later conclusions, as extremely foolish. A woodcut, copied from
an edition of King Olave Tryggiason's Saga, printed in 1665, and with
a scutcheon of the debased form only introduced in the seventeenth
century, is gravely produced as an ancient representation of the Norwegian
king, in order that by comparing his crown with that worn by
the crucified Saviour on the bell-case, its decided <i>Scandinavian character</i>
may be seen. The crown is neither more nor less than the
common one, surmounted by three <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, which, had a native
origin been sought for it, might have been seen along with the Maltese
or Greek cross pat&eacute;e, referred to in the same article, on almost
any Scottish silver coin from Malcolm Canmore to James IV., when
it is for the first time superseded on our native currency by a close
crown. It is no less common on contemporary English, and indeed
European coins; and as an argument, one way or other in the present
question, is utterly valueless. On equally inconclusive grounds the
Greek cross pat&eacute;e is pronounced to be Scandinavian. In proof of the
thorough consistency of its form with the usages of the early British
Church centuries before the first Scandinavian convert had abandoned
the Pagan creed of his fathers, it may suffice to observe that it closely
corresponds to the beautiful gold cross found in a grave in the Cathedral
of Durham, on the breast of an ecclesiastic, believed, at the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>its discovery, to be that of St. Cuthbert, which would assign it to the
seventh century. It is sufficient for our purpose, however, that both
its style and the circumstances under which it was discovered equally
prove its great antiquity and its native workmanship, points perhaps
hardly requiring to be discussed.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The "well-known Runic knots"
are next quoted, these being what we are familiar with on decorative
borders of Irish MSS., some of which date two centuries prior to the
first known descents of Scandinavian Vikings on our shores, and which
are no less common on Anglo-Saxon MSS. and relics, on Anglo-Norman
and Scottish Romanesque architecture, and indeed predominated
in the prevailing style of ornament for a time throughout Europe.
Lastly, we have a figure copied from an ancient "Runic monument,"
representing a person ringing a large suspended belfry-bell, measuring&mdash;if
any proportion is preserved&mdash;about three feet in height.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
This, therefore, can manifestly have no possible bearing on the history
of the little Scottish hand-bell, or rather bell-case, which measures
somewhat less than six inches high.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 535px;">
<img src="images/image654.jpg" width="535" height="520" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Bell of St. Columba.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is not difficult to shew that bells were in use in Scotland upwards
of four centuries before the conversion of St. Olaf and his Norwegian
Jarls. They were indeed introduced by the first Christian missionaries,
and summoned the brethren of Iona to prayer, while yet the
<i>gloriosum c&#339;nobium</i> of the
sacred isle was only a few
wattled huts. The reference
which Adomnan
makes to St. Columba's
bell, when he had notice
that King Aidan was going
forth to battle, sufficiently
indicates the use of it for
that purpose:&mdash;"Sanctus
subito ad suum dicit ministratorem
cloccam pulsa.
Cujus sonitu fratres incitati
ad ecclesiam ocius
currunt."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> We have as
little reason for supposing that the frail currach of St. Columba was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>freighted with a ponderous church bell, as that the first monastery
of Iona was distinguished by a lofty belfry tower. But the little hand-bell
of the primitive bishop would abundantly suffice to summon together
the band of pioneers in the wilderness of Iona. If the annexed
engraving does not represent the identical bell of the Scottish Apostle,
it is one consecrated to him, and sufficiently primitive in its character
to have called together the family of Iona to their orisons, beneath the
osier groins of the first cathedral of the isles. It is the bell of St.
Columbkill, now in the collection of John Bell, Esq. of Dungannon. The
original, which measures nearly seven inches in height, was preserved
for many generations in the family of the M'Gurks, from whose ancestors
the parish of Termon-Maguirk, in the county of Tyrone, takes its
name.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> This bell was held by the native Irish even of the present generation
in peculiar veneration, and though usually called by them the <i>Clog</i>
<i>na Choluimchille</i>, or bell of St. Columbkill, it also bore the name of
&#42873;&#617;&#593; &#42874;&#617;o&#x1D79;&#x0307;&#593;&#621;&#42887;u&#42885;, or God's Vengeance, alluding to the curse implicitly
believed to fall on any who perjure themselves by swearing
falsely on it. This bell was used until very lately, throughout the
county of Tyrone, in cases of solemn asseveration; but much of its
essential virtue must have exhaled on its transference to the repositories
of the antiquary. The Kilmichael-Glassrie bell, now in the
Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, appears to have closely corresponded
to the simple iron <i>clag</i> figured above. Within the beautiful
brass shrine figured on <i>Plate</i> VI. is a rude iron bell, so greatly corroded
that its original form can only be imperfectly traced; yet this,
and not the shrine, was obviously the chief object of veneration,
and may indeed be assumed with much probability to be some centuries
older than the ornamental case in which it is preserved. The
name of <i>Dia Dioghaltus</i>, or God's Vengeance, specially appropriated
to the bell of St. Columba, is applicable to all the relics of this class,
which we shall find were among the most venerated objects of the
primitive Celtic church.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if any such ecclesiastical implements or symbols
of office ever pertained to the Scandinavian Church, though it is
not improbable that they may have been in general use throughout
the earlier Christian countries of Europe some centuries before Scandinavia
abandoned the creed of Odin. In Ireland, Scotland, and
Wales, at any rate, we have abundant evidence of their ancient pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>valence,
and of the great sanctity universally attached to them; and,
indeed, in Ireland, from whence the bell of St. Columba, as well as
so much else that pertains to the early Christianity of Scotland, appear
to have been derived, the small consecrated bell is still comparatively
common. In the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy there
are eighteen different examples, including several of an exceedingly
primitive character. One of the most remarkable, though not the
earliest, of these is the inscribed C&#621;o&#7545; &#7683;e&#593;nu&#617;&#7545;h&#42887;&#775;e,
or Blessed Bell, called by Dr.
Petrie the Bell of Armagh,
which may serve as an example
of this singular class
of ecclesiastical Celtic relics.
Giraldus Cambrensis, in his
Welsh Itinerary, refers to
the universal veneration with
which these portable bells
were regarded in Scotland
and Ireland, as well as in
Wales, remarking that men
were more afraid of swearing
falsely by them than by the Gospels, because of some hidden and
miraculous power with which they were gifted, as well as for fear of
the saint to whom they pertained. The following account of this
unique relic furnished to me by Mr. Bell of Dungannon affords a singularly
lively illustration of the superstitions with which such relics
have been regarded even in our own day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/image656.jpg" width="511" height="534" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The bell of Ballynaback, better known as the <i>Clog beanuighte</i>, was preserved
in a family named Henning, whose residence is on the low road between Lurgan
and Portadown, in the county of Armagh. Unlike other ancient Irish quadrilateral
bells it bears on one of its sides an incised inscription, which renders it interesting,
since the Church of Rome permitted only a cross or the image of the patron saint
to be engraved on such ecclesiastical bells. It would be idle to attempt recounting
the miraculous judgments visited on such as profaned or violated the oaths
taken on the bell, or the wide-spread desolation which befell such as were anathematized
by it; for, early in the twelfth century, as we are told by Meredith Hanmer,
William of Winchester, by the authority of Celestine II., in a council held at
London, brought in the use of cursing with bell, book, and candle, 'which liked
the Irish priests well, to terrifie the laytie for their tithes.'</p>

<p>"Paul Henning was the last keeper of the Clog beanuighte; and when any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
his connexions died it was rung by him in front of the <i>namna gul</i>, the old women
who, according to the Irish fashion, <i>caoine</i> and bewail the dead. It was an ancient
custom to place the bell near any of the Hennings when dangerously ill. I visited
Mrs. Henning, the widow of Paul Henning, on her deathbed. She lay in a large
badly lighted apartment crowded with people. The bell, which had remained
several days near her head, seemed to be regarded by those who were present with
much interest. The vapour of the heated chamber was so condensed on the cold
metal of the bell, that occasionally small streams trickled down its sides. This
'heavy sweating' of the bell, as it was termed, was regarded by every one with
peculiar horror, and deemed a certain prognostication of the death of the sick
woman, who departed this life a few hours after I left the room. The agonized
bell, I was told, had on many previous occasions given similar tokens as proofs of
its sympathy on the approaching demise of its guardians."</p></div>

<p>The object of such profound veneration is now safely deposited in
the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin. The inscription
upon it&mdash;&#10016; O&#42883;o&#617;&#42887; &#593;&#42883; Ch&uacute; m&#593; Sc&#593; ch &#7745; &#593;&#617;&#621;euo&mdash;has been thus
read: <i>Oroil ar chum ma scahan chun ecumn aileou</i>,&mdash;A prayer for him
who shaped my frame to sound Allelujah. Both the rounded form
and the inscription on the <i>Clog beanuighte</i>, are evidence of its being
of a later date than the simpler quadrangular form; and it is unhesitatingly
assigned by Dr. Petrie as a work executed towards the close
of the ninth century.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> The same quadrangular form of hand-bell is
represented on some of the Irish stone crosses of the ninth and tenth
centuries, and is also introduced in a curious group sculptured on the
pediment of a remarkable little oratory called the Priest's Church, at
Glendalough, which Dr. Petrie ascribes to the middle of the eighth
century.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> The following notice in the Annotations of Tirechan, in
the Book of Armagh, is extremely interesting, as shewing the bell
among the ecclesiastical gifts bestowed on Fiac, Bishop of Sletty, when
St. Patrick conferred on him the episcopal dignity, and may therefore
suffice to account for its possession by St. Columba as one of the
most essential insignia of the pastoral office:&mdash;"Patrick conferred the
degree of bishop upon him, so that he was the first bishop that was
ordained among the Lagenians; and Patrick gave a box to Fiacc,
containing a bell, and a menstir, and a crozier, and a poolire; and he
left seven of his people with him."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>With such indubitable evidence of the use of the consecrated bell as
one of the most essential ecclesiastical implements of the first missionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>bishops, we can be at no loss to account for the origin of the beautiful
relic found on the farm of Torrebhlaurn, in the parish of Kilmichael-Glassrie,
Argyleshire. The accompanying accurate engraving (<i>Plate</i>
VI.) renders any minute description unnecessary. It is an ornamental
square case or shrine, attached to the bottom of which is a thin plate
of brass pierced with a circular hole in the centre. Inside this case,
but entirely detached from it, is the rude and greatly corroded iron
bell. When first discovered it appeared to have been carefully
wrapped in a piece of woollen cloth then almost entirely decayed.
The hole in the lower plate is large enough to admit of the insertion
of the finger, and was perhaps designed to allow of the bell being
touched as a consecrated and miraculously gifted relic, without removing
it from its case. Dr. Petrie remarks on the quadrangular
form of the Irish portable bells as an evidence of their great antiquity,
and refers to the inscribed one in the Dublin Museum as a remarkable
example of the transition to the later circular form in the ninth
century.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> A bell of the oblong rounded form rudely fashioned out of
a sheet of bronze, found at Marden, in Herefordshire, is engraved in
the Archæological Journal.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
The simplicity of its form
and construction abundantly
justify its assignment to
nearly the same early period.</p>

</div>

<p>At no very remote date
several of these ancient consecrated
bells were to be
found in Scotland, and evidence
of the most satisfactory
kind proves the former existence
of others dedicated
to primitive Scottish saints,
nor is it at all improbable
that some of these may still
be preserved. The accompanying engraving represents one example
manifestly of the earliest and most primitive form. It was obtained
some years ago in Perthshire, and now forms one of the many valuable
Scottish relics in the collection of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe,
Esq.; but unfortunately no clue exists to its original dedication or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>the local associations of its early history. This primitive bell measures
four and a quarter inches in height, including the handle, and
three and three-quarters, by one and three-quarters inches, at the
mouth. It is fashioned out of a single plate of sheet-iron; and the
ring which forms the handle externally projects internally, so as to
form a loop, from which the clapper was suspended.</p>

<p>Though no representations of these singular relics of the Celtic
church have been introduced on the sculptured crosses, they are
figured on various early Scottish seals. The bell of St. Kentigern,
the great apostle of Strathclyde, was an object of devout veneration
at Glasgow for many centuries; and after forming a prominent
feature in the armorial bearings of the archiepiscopal see, still
figures in the modern city's arms. There has even been thought
to be sufficient evidence to justify the belief of the original bell
having escaped the indiscriminate destruction of sacred relics at the
Reformation, from an entry in the accounts of the city treasurer
for the year 1578, of a charge of two shillings "for ane tong to
Sanct Mungowe's bell."<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> But it may be doubted if this could be
the original bell of the western saint, which is figured on the ancient
seal of the community of the city, used in the reign of Robert
I., and also on the contemporary chapter seal, and described by Father
Innes as on the burgh seal attached to a charter, now lost, of the
year 1293.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> On the former of these its form is very distinctly shewn,
completely corresponding to the earliest square portable bells with
looped handles. Its introduction on these seals attests the great reverence
with which it was regarded; and various references both in
the <i>Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis</i>, and in the <i>Liber Collegii</i>
<i>Nostre Domine, Glasguensis</i>, <span class="smcap">MDXLIX</span>, to the <i>Campana Beati Kentegerni</i>,
abundantly confirm the evidence of its sanctity. It is also repeatedly
referred to in the Aberdeen Breviary, as in the anthem appointed
for the day of the apostle of Strathclyde:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Visitat alma pii vite septenta loca Petri<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presul <i>campana</i> cui seruit in ethere sacra.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An author of the seventeenth century affirms that the venerable
relic survived even in the reign of Charles I.;<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> nor is there anything
inconceivable in this, when so many others of the same kind are still
preserved. But it is not at all probable that the bell on which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>citizens of Glasgow, in 1587, expended two shillings in repair was
of so unpractical a form as their old burgh seal proves the original
<i>campana</i> of their patron saint to have been. More probably it was
a large bell in the tower of St. Mungo's Cathedral, for the repair of
which the specified sum might then prove amply sufficient, as appears
from a somewhat earlier entry in the same Burgh Records: "Decimo
Maii, 1577, to George Burell, for ane tag to &thorn;e towng of &thorn;e hie kirk
bell, xx<sup>d.</sup>"<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> From the inscription on the present great bell of the
cathedral it appears that it was presented
by Marcus Knox, a wealthy
citizen, in 1594, the old one, after repeated
repairs, having at length, it
may be presumed, entirely given way.
The woodcut represents another of
these ancient Celtic relics, which,
though preserved along with other
memorials of Ireland's saints, in the
valuable collection of Mr. Bell of
Dungannon, pertains to one of the
primitive apostles of his own native
land, the celebrated Scottish missionary
bishop, St. Ninian or St. Ringan. The <i>Clog-rinny</i>, or bell of St.
Ninian, is rude enough to have been contemporary with the Candida
Casa of Whithern in Galloway, and to have summoned to the preaching
of the missionary bishop the first of the tribes of North Briton
converted to the worship of the true God.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The honour attached to the custody of the most sacred relics occasioned
in various cases the creation of special offices, with emoluments
and lands pertaining to their holders, and the transference of these
to lay impropriators on the overthrow of the ancient ecclesiastical
system, has led to the preservation of some few of the relics of primitive
Scottish saints, even to our own day. But for the rude shock of
civil war which, in the last century, involved so many of our oldest
nobility in the ruined fortunes of the fated Stuart race, more of these
might still have been in existence. Both the "<i>Sacra Campana</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span><i>Sancti Kessogii</i>," and the "<i>Sacra Campana Sancti Lolani</i>," were
included among the feudal investitures of the earldom of Perth&mdash;a
sufficiently significant proof of the value ascribed to them. They
are referred to so recently as the year 1675.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> Less reverential motives
probably led to the preservation of the <i>Clagan</i>, or Little Bell of
St. Barry, a favourite old Celtic saint who gives name to the district
of Argyleshire where he is said to have ministered. This relic,
which remained till the close of last century in the possession of the
principal heritor of Kilberry parish, was somewhat larger, and probably
of less hoar antiquity, than the primitive ecclesiastical memorials
previously described. "The bell of St. Barry's Chapel," says
the compiler of the Old Account of the Parish of South Knapdale,
"is still in preservation at Kilberry Castle, and has been long prostituted
to the ignoble purpose of summoning the servants of that
family to their meals. It is inscribed with the saint's name in the
Latin language and Saxon character, but unfortunately without
date."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> I learn on inquiry, from J. Campbell, Esq., the present proprietor
of Kilberry Castle, that the ancient bell of St. Barry no longer
exists. In a letter with which he has favoured me, he remarks,&mdash;"I
have heard my father say that it fell down and cracked. The
metal was recast into another bell, which is here now. I have heard
him mention the inscription, but do not believe there was any copy
of it kept." A remarkable stone cross, with the figure of our
Saviour upon it, and numerous sculptured and incised tombstones,
still remain around the site of the ancient chapel of St. Barry, the
ruins of which were only demolished a few years ago. An inscription
upon it bore that it had been plundered and burnt by Captain Pooley,
an English rover, in 1513.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>More minute information relative to the preservation of another of
the ancient Scottish saints' bells, as the evidence of hereditary right
to the privileges attached to its custodier, is supplied by "The Airlie
Papers," printed in the Spalding Miscellany. One of these is a formal
resignation of the Bell of St. Meddan, by Michael Dauid, its
hereditary curator, to Sir John Ogilvy; and the transference of it by
him to his wife Margaret, Countess of Moray, of date 27th June
1447. It is followed by "the instrument of sessyn of the bell,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>dated twenty-one days later, from which we discover the substantial
advantages pertaining to the custody of this relic. The Countess
was thereby put in possession of a house or toft near the church of
Luntrethin, which pertained to the bell, of which it formed both the
title and evidence of tenure. "The instrument of sessyn" further
describes the formal process of investiture, the Countess having been
shut into the house by herself, after receiving the feudal symbols of
resignation of the property by the delivery to her of earth and
stone.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>The Aberdeen Breviary commemorates another Scottish bell, pertaining
to St. Ternan, the apostle of the Picts, and presented to him
by Pope Gregory the Great. It was preserved, with other relics of
the saint, at the church which was erected over his tomb at Banchory,
Aberdeenshire; and legal deeds of the fifteenth century are extant
to shew the importance attached to the custody "of the bell of
Sanct Ternan, callit <i>the Ronecht</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>&mdash;a name most probably derived
from the Gaelic <i>Ronnaich</i>, a poet, <i>rannach</i>, a songster, in allusion to
its melodious sounds, though such is by no means a usual characteristic
of these primitive bells, their <i>clogarnach</i> or tinkling being
anything but musical. The Old Account of the Parish of Killin, in
Perthshire, furnishes the description of the bell of another favourite
Celtic saint&mdash;that of St. Fillan, who flourished in the middle of the
seventh century&mdash;not only preserved, but had in reverence for its
miraculous powers, almost to the close of the eighteenth century:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a bell belonging to the chapel of St. Fillan, that was in high reputation
among the votaries of that saint in old times. It seems to be of some mixed
metal. It is about a foot high, and of an oblong form. It usually lay on a grave-stone
in the churchyard. When mad people were brought to be dipped in the
saint's pool, it was necessary to perform certain ceremonies, in which there was a
mixture of Druidism and Popery. After remaining all night in the chapel bound
with ropes, the bell was set upon their head with great solemnity. It was the
popular opinion that, if stolen, it would extricate itself out of the thief's hands,
and return home ringing all the way. For some years past this bell has been
locked up to prevent its being used to superstitious purposes."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p></div>

<p>Pennant visited the locality, and describes the peculiar gifts of
healing ascribed to the saint, but he does not appear to have known
of his bell. Some portions of the ruined chapel exist, and the pool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>of Strathfillan remains as of yore, still distinguished by the peasantry
as the Holy Pool, and even visited by some who have faith in its
virtue; but if the bell is to be seen, it must be sought for among
the treasures of some private collector. "It was stolen," says the
author of the recent Account of Killin Parish, writing in 1843, "by
an English antiquarian about forty years ago." Unhappily the old
virtues of the bell had departed, or the saint no longer favours a
faithless generation, else its potent <i>clogarnach</i> should long since have
announced its return to Strathfillan.</p>

<p>On the Island of Inniskenneth, which is affirmed to derive its name
from Kenneth, a friend of St. Columba, whom the prayer of the saint
rescued from drowning&mdash;probably the St. Kenanach of Irish hagiology&mdash;there
are the ruins of an ancient chapel of small dimensions, about
sixty feet in length, and near to it the remains of a cross, with numerous
tombstones both of early and recent date. Here, towards the
close of last century, according to the Old Account of the Parish, an
ancient bell, most probably that of St. Kenanach, and described by
the Statist as "a small bell used at the celebration of mass," was
then preserved in the chapel.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> This example, it is possible, may still
be preserved in private hands; and with so many evidences of the
recent existence of these relics of the first preachers of the faith in
Scotland, it is not unreasonable to conceive that others may also be
in safe keeping among the heirlooms of the older Highland families,
which a wider diffusion of a just spirit of reverence for our national
antiquities may bring to light. Meanwhile, these notices suffice to
shew that the beautiful bell found at Torrebhlaurn is by no means
unique in Scotland. Probably none of the earlier Christian missionaries
were without such a potent relic; and the only Scandinavian
influence which history would justify us in connecting with them, is
the diminution of their number and the spoiling and slaying of their
owners, down to the comparatively late date of St. Olaf's conversion,
and his mission to the Pagan Norsemen of the Orkneys, armed with
more carnal weapons than the bishop's crosier and consecrated bell.
With these venerable memorials of the first preachers of Christianity
to the heathen Picts and Scots, may also be mentioned a more modern
relic of the same class, a graceful little hand-bell, presented to the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1783, but of which the previous
history is unknown. It is decorated, in basso-relievo, on the one side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>with the temptation of Adam and Eve, and on the other with the
crucifixion. It is no doubt also an old ecclesiastical bell, though belonging
to a period long subsequent to the era of St. Kentigern or St.
Fillan.</p>

<p>But another and still more interesting relic of St. Fillan, even
than his bell, has descended safely to our own day. An English
tourist of last century communicated to the Society of Antiquaries
the following account of the crosier of St. Fillan, which, with the
miracle-working bell of the Saint of Strathfillan, continued then to
occupy the ancient scene of his ministration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At Killin, July 5, 1782, in the house of Malice Doire, a day-labourer, I was
shewn what he called the <i>Quigrich</i>. It is the head of a crosier, formerly belonging
to St. Fillan, who gave name to a neighbouring Strath. I entreat the Society to
excuse the rudeness of the representation annexed, it being the hasty sketch of a
traveller, particularly as it is only meant to lead them to the possession of the
original. With it is shewn a copy of the king's letters of appropriation and
security, which I have carefully transcribed. The neighbours conducted me to
the envied possessor of this relic, who exhibited it according to the intent of the
royal investment. A youth of nineteen, the representative of his father's name,
and presumptive heir to this treasure, lay drooping in an outer apartment, under
the last gasp of a consumption."<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/image664.jpg" width="461" height="558" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The royal investment referred to in the letter is granted by James
III., in the year 1487, and sets
forth that "Forasmekle as we
have understand that oure servitour
Malice Doire and his
forebears has had ane relick of
Saint Filane, callit the <i>Quigrich</i>,
in keping of ws and of
oure progenitouris of maist nobill
mynde, quham God assolyie, sen the tyme of King
Robert the Bruys and of before, and made nane obedience
nor answer to na persoun, spirituale nor temporale,
in ony thing concerning the said haly relick utherwayis
than what is contenit in the auld infeftment thareof,
made and grantit be oure said progenitouris, we charge,"
&amp;c.; and the royal letters accordingly go on to warrant
the custodier of the precious relic to bear it through the
country without let or hindrance, as his fathers were wont to do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span></p>
<p>The owner of the Quigrich afterwards emigrated to America, carrying
the ancient relic with him; and the following extract from a letter
which I have recently received from the Rev. Æneas M'Donell
Dawson, whose own immediate ancestors were for a time the guardians
of St. Fillan's crosier, will shew that it is still in safety, though
unfortunately severed from nearly all those national and local associations
which confer on it so peculiar an interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The celebrated crook of St. Fillan is still in Canada, and in the keeping of the
very family to whose ancestor it was confided on the Field of Bannockburn, when
the king, displeased with the abbot for having abstracted from it the relics of St.
Fillan previously to the battle, from want of confidence, it is alleged, in the success
of the Scottish cause, deprived him of the guardianship.</p>

<p>"This family, it appears, lost possession of the crosier for a time, having disposed
of it for a sum of money to an ancestor of my mother's family, who adhered
to the ancient faith. Soon after this transaction, however, ceasing to prosper, and
attributing their change of circumstances to their indifference to a sacred object
that had been solemnly entrusted to them, they persuaded the purchaser, or rather
the person who inherited the crosier from him, to part with it in their favour. I
am not aware of the date of their removal to Canada, but I could ascertain it
through the kindness of a gentleman resident in the same parish, who went to their
house expressly to see the crosier, in order that he might be able to satisfy the
friends with whom I was corresponding as to its identity. He learned also that
they were in treaty some time ago with a Mr. Bruce of London&mdash;possibly the late
Lord Elgin(?)&mdash;for, I must not say the sale of it, but its restoration to this country.
&pound;500 was the sum they named at that time as its ransom."</p></div>

<p>A subsequent, but equally unsuccessful effort, for the recovery of
the Quigrich, was made by a gentleman who possesses estates within
the favoured district sanctified of old by the labours of St. Fillan, but
equally unfaithful as the bell of Strathfillan, it has failed to return to
its ancient locality. The accompanying view is taken from the
sketch above referred to, the general accuracy of which is corroborated
by the correspondent already quoted. The crosier is of silver-gilt,
and weighs about seven or eight pounds. It is hollow at the
lower end for the insertion of the staff. On the other extremity,
which is flat, a cross is engraved with a star on each side of it, and a
large oval crystal is set in the front of the short limb. The simple
form of this remarkable relic amply suffices to confirm the great antiquity
assigned to it.</p>

<p>The ancient crosier of St. Molocus, another favourite Celtic saint,
has in like manner escaped the ravages of time, and the iconoclastic
zeal of the reformers of the sixteenth century, and after being pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>served
for centuries in the immediate vicinity of the cathedral of
Lismore, has recently come into the possession of the present Duke
of Argyle. It is known in the district by the simple name of the
<i>Baculum More</i>, or big staff; and consists of a plain curved staff, formerly
decorated with silver at the top, but long since spoiled of its
costlier ornaments. The right of its curatorship, and probably also
of bearing it before the bishops of Argyle, appears to have been
hereditary, and conferred on its holders the possession of a small
freehold estate, which remained in the hands of the lineal descendant
of the old staff-bearer till within the last few years. This estate was
latterly held under a deed granted by the Earl of Argyle in 1544,
the ancient crosier being preserved in verification of the right, till it
was recently delivered up, in return for new titles granted, in order
to enable the late owner, the last of his race, to dispose of the freehold,
which could no longer descend to his heirs. The original
charter of confirmation grants,&mdash;"Dilecto signiffero nostro Johanni

<div class="figright" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/image666.jpg" width="249" height="529" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Two other ancient episcopal crosiers
remain to be noticed, each of them
associated with Scottish sees. The
one here engraved was found, in its
present imperfect state, along with a
glove and other relics, in the course
of some excavations in the choir of the
cathedral of Fortrose, when a stone
coffin was discovered, which doubtless
contained the remains of one of the
old bishops of Ross. This interesting
relic was presented by Sir George Mackenzie to the Society of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
Antiquaries of Scotland in 1822, and is now preserved in their
Museum. It retains traces both of colour and gilding, and though
greatly decayed and imperfect, is still characterized by considerable
elegance. It measures the segment of a circle of about five inches in
diameter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/image667.jpg" width="203" height="529" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The other crosier referred to belongs to the ancient see of St. Magnus
in the Orkneys, and likewise owes its preservation, like the relics of
more primitive eras, to the medieval practice of depositing the symbols
of the chief pastoral office beside the remains of the deceased bishop.
During the progress of the recent judicious
restorations in the choir of the cathedral at
Kirkwall, in the month of August 1848, a
modern flooring was removed, which concealed
the bases of the columns and piers. Several
ancient tombs were brought to light by this
means, and in one place on the north side of
the altar steps, a finely carved slab of stone
was exposed. On removing this, a small
vaulted chamber or cist was discovered, within
which lay a skeleton greatly decayed, and
beside it the crosier figured, carved in oak,
and a chalice and paten, both roughly modelled,
apparently in the common white wax
frequently used in ancient seals. The chalice,
though somewhat imperfect round the lip, is
otherwise entire, but the paten is greatly injured, and both are
little more than rude symbols of these most essential sacred vessels
used in the service of the mass. The oaken crosier measures eleven
and a half inches long as figured here, but it is notched at the lower
extremity, evidently for the purpose of attaching it to a staff. The
tomb has been supposed to be that of Thomas de Tulloch, circa 1422-1448&mdash;a
date with which the style of ornament of the crosier very
well agrees, but there is no sufficient evidence to enable it to be assigned
with certainty to a particular individual. Nearly at the same
time as these interesting episcopal memorials were brought to light,
a very curious discovery was made of human remains inclosed in one
of the pillars of the western or most ancient portion of the choir, at
a height of nearly twelve feet from the floor. There was an indentation
or cut in the skull, which, with the singular position of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span>
vault, induced some of the northern antiquaries to hazard the conjecture
that they had discovered the remains of their patron saint,
the good Earl Magnus: a thing not altogether inconceivable. It was
nearly at the same time that the tomb of William, the first resident
bishop of the Northern Isles, was exposed, as already described.</p>

<p>The form of the ancient Scottish chalice, as indicated on early
tombs, corresponds, as might be expected, to the general usage
of the medieval Church. The wax model found in the supposed
tomb of Bishop Tulloch at Orkney, indicates the same conformity
to the prevailing fashions of the age. The peculiar arts, however,
which modified the sepulchral and monumental sculpture, as
well as the architecture of the primitive Scottish Church, doubtless
also occasionally conferred equally characteristic forms on the sacred
vessels and other articles of Church furnishing.</p>

<p>The chalice is figured on various early Scottish ecclesiastical seals,
as well as on sepulchral slabs and other medieval sculptures. But an
original Scottish chalice, a relic of the venerable abbey of St. Columba,
preserved till a very few years since an older example of the sacred
vessels of the altar than is indicated in any existing memorial of the
medieval Church. The later history of this venerable relic is replete
with interest. It was of fine gold, of a very simple form, and ornamented
in a style that gave evidence of its belonging to a very early
period. It was transferred from the possession of Sir Lauchlan MacLean
to the Glengarry family, in the time of Æneas, afterwards
created by Charles II. Lord Macdonell and Arross, under the circumstances
narrated in the following letter from a cousin of the celebrated
Marshal Macdonald, Duke of Tarentum, and communicated to me by
a clergyman,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> who obtained it from the family of the gentleman to
whom it was originally addressed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The following anecdote I heard from the late bishop, John Chisholm, and from
Mr. John M'Eachan, uncle to the Duke of Tarentum, who died at my house at
Irin Moidart, aged upwards of one hundred years:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maclean of Duart expecting an invasion of his lands in Mull, by his powerful
neighbour the Earl of Argyll, applied to Glengarry for assistance. Æneas of Glengarry
marched at the head of five hundred men to Ardtornish, nearly opposite
Duart Castle, and crossing with a few of his officers to arrange the passage of the
men across the Sound of Mull, Maclean, rejoicing at the arrival of such a friend,
offered some choice wine in a golden chalice, part of the plunder of Iona. Glengarry
was struck with horror, and said, folding his handkerchief about the chalice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>'Maclean, I came here to defend you against mortal enemies, but since by sacrilege
and profanation you have made God your enemy, no human means can serve
you.' Glengarry returned to his men, and Maclean sent the chalice and some
other pieces of plate belonging to the service of the altar, with a deputation of his
friends, to persuade him to join him; but he marched home. His example was
followed by several other chiefs, and poor Maclean was left to compete single-handed
with his powerful enemy."</p></div>

<p>Such was the last historical incident connected with the golden
chalice of Iona, perhaps without exception the most interesting ecclesiastical
relic which Scotland possessed. Unfortunately its later
history only finds a parallel in that of the celebrated Danish golden
horns. It was preserved in the charter-chest of Glengarry, until it
was presented by the late Chief to Bishop Ronald M'Donald, on
whose demise it came into the possession of his successor, Dr. Scott,
Bishop of Glasgow. Only five years since the sacristy of St. Mary's
Roman Catholic Church in that city, where it was preserved, was
broken into, and before the police could obtain a clue to the depredators,
the golden relic of Iona was no longer a chalice. Thus perished
by the hands of a common felon a memorial of the spot consecrated by
the labours of some of the earliest Christian missionaries to the Pagan
Caledonians, and which had probably survived the vicissitudes of upwards
of ten centuries. In reply to inquiries made as to the existence
of any drawing of the chalice, or even the possibility of a trustworthy
sketch being executed from memory, a gentleman in Glasgow writes:&mdash;"I
have no means of getting even a sketch from which to make a
drawing. Were I a good hand myself I could easily furnish one, having
often examined it. It was a chalice that no one could look on
without being convinced of its very great antiquity. The workmanship
was rude, the ornamental drawings or engravings even more hard
than medieval ones in their outlines, and the cup bore mark of the
original hammering which had beaten it into shape."</p>

<p>The oldest existing Scottish relic of this class is the "Dunvegan
Cup," celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in his "Lord of the Isles," and
still sacredly guarded in the Castle of Dunvegan, in Skye, along with
other Celtic heirlooms of the chiefs of MacLeod. "The Horn of
Rorie More," says Scott, "preserved in the family, and recorded by
Dr. Johnson, is not to be compared with this piece of antiquity,
which is one of the greatest curiosities in Scotland." Its dimensions
are nine inches and three quarters in inside depth, ten and a half in
height on the outside, the extreme measure over the lips being four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
inches and a half. The engraving on <i>Plate</i> VI. is from a private
plate in the possession of C. K. Sharpe, Esq., executed from a drawing
by Mrs. MacLeod. Another, but much less accurate or minute view of
this curious relic is given in the Archæologia, from a sketch by Mr.
Daniell.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> These will serve better than any elaborate description to
convey a correct idea of its peculiar form. The material of the cup
is wood, to all appearance oak, most curiously wrought and embossed
with silver work. A series of projecting bosses appear to have been
jewelled, and two or three of them still retain their simple settings.
The ledge, the projecting brim, and the four legs which support the
cup, are of silver, which with the other silver mountings appear to
have been gilt. Around the exterior is an inscription in Gothic
characters, which Sir Walter Scott deciphered nearly as follows:<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>&mdash;</p>

<i>Hi Manæ Vich Liahia Magryneil et sperat Domino Jhesu dari clementiam</i>
<i>illi deæ ipsa. Fecit Anno Domini 993 Onili Oimi.</i> The
inscription is a curious specimen of early Celtic Latinity:&mdash;Ufo, the
son of John, the son of Magnus, Prince of the Isle of Man, the grandson
of Liahia Macgryneil, trusts in the Lord Jesus that mercy will be
given to him in that day. Oneil Oimi made this in the year of God
nine hundred and ninety-three. Within the mouth of the cup, on
each of the four sides, is the sacred monogram, <span class="antiqua">i.h.s.</span>, which, coupled
with the tenour of the inscription, leaves little room to doubt, notwithstanding
its unusual form, that it had been originally designed
for a chalice, and gifted by Ufo for the service of the altar. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>family legends of the Macleods associate it with some old traditional
chief or hero, Neil Ghlune-dhu, or Black-knee, but it seems to have
been a family heirloom from time immemorial.</p>

<p>The use of wooden vessels as chalices was, for obvious reasons,
abandoned at an early period, so that the <i>calices lignei</i> became in
later ages a proverbial illustration of the obsolete simplicity of primitive
ages. "We may now take up that old regrait," exclaims Fountainhall,
in moralizing on the immense wealth first acquired by the
Church, about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 600, "when ther ware <i>calices lignei</i> ther ware
then <i>sacerdotes aurei</i>, but now when our chalices are of gold and
silver, we have got <i>ligneos sacerdotes</i>."<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Vessels of wood, even though
mounted and jewelled, like the Dunvegan chalice, were very early
disused in the services of the altar; and the mazer cup or maple
bowl constituted one of the most prominent implements in the conviviality
of the Middle Ages. The name indeed ceased at an early
period to be exclusively reserved for those manufactured from the
wood of the maple tree, from whence the mazer had derived its name,
and was at length applied to all drinking cups of a certain class, of
whatever material. Among the beautiful examples of medieval art
recently exhibited at the London Royal Society of Arts, was a
beautiful mazer bowl of silver-gilt, of fifteenth century workmanship,
which belongs to Oriel College, Oxford. Of the same class also,
probably, were some of the Scottish cups enumerated in a curious
inventory of the treasure and jewels of James III., "fundin in a
bandit kist like a gardeviant," among which are the "<span class="smcap">foure masaris,</span>
<span class="smcap">callit King Robert the Brocis</span>, with a cover," and again, "the hede
of silver of ane of the coveris of masar." The same "Collection of
Inventorys of Royal Wardrobe and Jewell-house," from 1488 to 1606,
furnishes some interesting minutiæ in regard to the royal plate and
jewels, and the consecrated vessels for the service of the altar. Besides
the mazers, there is "ane cowp callit king Robert the Bruce coupe,
of silver owirgilt,"&mdash;another pleasing evidence of the reverence with
which the name of the saviour of his country continued to be regarded.
The royal plate and jewels are of an exceedingly curious and costly
character, while among the "chapell geir" we find "ane chesabill of
purpour velvot, with the stoyle and fannowne, orphis, twa abbis," &amp;c.
Another of "crammosie velvot, furniset with a stole and a fannoun
only;" another "of black velvot, with croce upoune it, broderrit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>of clayth of gold." Altar cloths, broidered and jewelled; "ane challeis
and ane patene gilt;" "ane caise of silver for the messbreid,
with ane cover;" "ane litil cors with precious stanis;" "ane lytill
box of gold with the haly croce, send be the Duk of Albany to the
kingis graice;" "ane croce of silver, with our Lady and Sanct Johne,
gilt." Of silver, "ouregilt," in Edinburgh Castle, "twa chandleris,
ane chalice and ane patine, ane halie watter fatt," &amp;c.; "ane bell
of silver;" "ane bassing; ane laver of fyne massy gold, with thrissillis
and lelleis crounit upoun the samen," &amp;c. The list indeed, of
which these are only a few illustrations, greatly exceeds what might
have been anticipated at a period succeeding many years of national
disaster and suffering. It is to be regretted that scarcely a solitary
example of the medieval Scottish "<i>chapell geir</i>," or of the royal mazer,
or convivial bowl, remains to illustrate the usages of our ancestors. We
learn, however, from these old inventories, that there was no lack of
either, and also that the value attached to the mazer cup dates in
Scotland, as elsewhere, from a very early period. This probably originated
in part from superstitious feelings, arising from some special
virtue attached to the wood of the maple tree. But its close grain,
the beauty of its variegated surface, and its susceptibility of high
polish, were doubtless the chief reasons for its continued use as the
material for the pledge-cup and wassail bowl; and when it was replaced
by other woods, or even by the precious metals, the old name was
still retained. The woodcut represents a mazer of very simple form,
and probably of an early age,
made not of the maple but
the ash, a tree famed of old
for many supernatural qualities.
It was found in the
deep draw-well, in the ruined
castle of Merdon, near Hursly,
built by Bishop Henry de
Blois, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1138.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The <i>ciphus</i>
<i>de mazero</i> frequently figures
among the household effects
of citizens of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, and
is no less commonly alluded to by the elder poets, as in Robert de
Brunne's version of Wace's <i>Brut</i>, written in the latter part of the
thirteenth century, where "mazers of rich price" are specified among
the gifts bestowed by king Arthur on his foreign guests. The mazer
figures also in the inventory of goods of the Sheriff of Nottingham,
taken by "Lytell John," as printed by Wynken de Worde, in the
popular black-letter ballad,&mdash;"A Lytell geste of Robyn Hode;" and
it is thus introduced in the fine old Scottish ballad of "Gill Morice,"</p>

<p>The mazer cup was evidently regarded as a family heirloom, and
as such inscribed with quaint legends and pious aphorisms, and sometimes
decorated with rich chasing and carving, as Chaucer has so
beautifully described in the "Mazer yrought of the maple," mentioned
in his Shepherd's Callender. The quaint simplicity, both of
the devices and inscriptions of many of the wassail bowls, furnishes
curious illustration of the manners and ideas of the age to which they
belong. Our forefathers had a pious, but withal a very convenient
fashion, of uniting religion with their daily sports, and even, as it
might seem, seeking to sanctify their excesses. Both Chaucer and
Dunbar wind up their freest versions of the Decameron with a pious
couplet, and in like spirit the old toper invoked the Trinity on the
rim of his wassail bowl, and engraved the mystic saint Christopher
within it. The woodcut represents a very beautiful mazer of the
time of Richard II., now in the possession of Evelyn Philip Shirley,
Esq, M.P. It is made of highly polished wood, apparently maple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
and hooped with a richly embossed rim of silver gilt, on which is inscribed,
as shewn in the annexed fac-simile of a portion of the "edgle
of sylver," the following characteristic invocation:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the tenor of such legends frequently inscribed on these ancient
cups, it has not been uncommon to describe them as sacred vessels,
designed only for use in the service of the Church. Thus a maple
cup, bearing the date 1608, was forwarded for exhibition at a meeting
of the British Archæological Association in 1848, as a chalice;<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> and
another, apparently of the same character, made in the year 1611, was
shewn to the members of the Archæological Institute in 1850, which
it was also conjectured "might have served in some rural parish as a
chalice."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> Such cups, however, were by no means rare in the beginning
of the seventeenth century, and though frequently inscribed in
terms calculated to suggest such a sacred character, there will generally
be found some accompaniment in the legend or devices no less
characteristic of mirth and good fellowship. On the 4th January
1667, Mr. Pepys notes in his gossiping Diary, having "last of all, a
flagon of ale and apples, drunk out of a wood cup, as a Christmas
draught, which made all merry." Fountainhall in his "Decisions,"
records some curious notes of an action brought by Sir Alexander
Ogilvie, afterwards Lord Forglen, in 1685, against Sir Alexander
Forbes of Tolquhoun, for stealing a gilded mazer cup out of his house,
which was afterwards accidentally discovered in the hands of a goldsmith
in Aberdeen, with whom its careless owner had left it some
years before for repair. From such glimpses as we recover of the
history of the litigants, neither of the old Scottish baronets seem
characters likely to have gifted chalices, even of maple or ashen wood,
though probably well fitted to match with Secretary Pepys in discussing
a "Christmas draught." One quaint, but very beautiful allusion,
however, is made by an old Scottish writer to the mazer cup, referring
to it metaphorically, as to a sacramental chalice. The passage occurs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>in Zacharie Boyd's "Last Battell of the Soule," published at Edinburgh
in 1629. "Take now," says he, "the cup of salvation, the
great <i>Mazer</i> of His mercy, and call upon the name of the Lord."</p>

<p>A curious wooden cup, in the collection of W. B. Johnstone, Esq.,
bearing the date 1611, serves to illustrate the character of the pious
legends graven on the mazers of the seventeenth century,&mdash;not unsuited
in part for the decoration of a sacramental chalice, but also accompanied
with other devices and allusions, which leave no doubt of the
real destination of the mazer for the convivial board. Its height is
nine inches, and its greatest circumference, a little below the brim,
nineteen inches. The outer surface of the bowl is divided into ornamental
compartments, within which are grouped the lion, unicorn,
stag, ostrich, hedgehog, dog, and cock, with trees, flowers, &amp;c. The
ostrich is represented regaling himself with a horse-shoe!<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> Around
the rim, bowl, stem, and even on the lower side of the stand, the
carver has indulged his moralizing vein, both in prose and verse. The
inscription on the bowl reads,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">THE FOUNTAYNE OF ALL HEALTH AND WEALTH AND JOYES,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">TO THIRSTY SOULES HE GIVETH DRINK INDEED;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">SUCH AS TURN TO HIM FROM THEIR EVILL WAYES<br /></span>
<span class="i4">SHALL FINDE SOUND COMFORT IN THEIR GREATEST NEEDE;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">BUT EVILL WORKERS THAT IN SINNE REMAINE,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">THEY ARE ORDAYNED TO ETERNALL PAYNE.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">FOR EVERY ONE OF US SHALL BE REWARDED ACCORDING TO<br /></span>
<span class="i0">OUR WORKES; THEREFORE REPENT UNFAYNEDLY AND AMEND.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Round the rim of the stand are the words and date:&mdash;<span class="smcap">THEY THAT</span>
<span class="smcap">SEEKE AFTER THE LORD SHALL PRAYSE HIM, THEIR HARTS SHALL LIVE</span>
<span class="smcap">FOR EVER. 1611.</span>; and then on the underside of the stand the cup thus
takes up the hortatory strain, in a mixed vein, in <i>propria persona</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">MISSUSE ME NOT ALTHOUGH I AM NO PLATE;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">A</span> MAPLE CUPP <span class="smcap">THAT IS NOT OUT OF DATE.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">DRINKE WELL, AND WELCOME, BUT BE NOT TOO FREE,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">EXAMINE WHETHER THAT IN CHRIST YOU BE;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">IF THAT YOUR FAITH BE TRUE, AND FIRM, AND SOUND,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">THEN IN ALL GOOD WORKS YOU WILL STILL ABOUND.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><span class="smcap">SO RUN THAT YE MAY OBTAYNE.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was perhaps a little quiet humour lurking in the mind of the
carver when he inscribed these latter excellent and very practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>
maxims on the underside of the stand, where it is only possible to
peruse them when the cup is empty! It will be seen that this
maple cup bears a very close resemblance to the contemporary vessels
of the same class referred to in the Journals of the Archæological
Association and of the Institute. Their odd devices and
quaint inscriptions are not unworthy of note by the historian as indicative
of the old Puritan spirit manifesting itself in this simple guise
during the reign of James, preparatory to its stern outbreak in that
of his son.</p>

<p>These spurious chalices of modern date have led us somewhat beyond
the legitimate bounds of the subject, though they cannot be
considered quite undeserving of a passing notice. Only one other
early Scottish relic remains to be noted,&mdash;a small brass box, closely
resembling several which have been found at various times in England,
and have been supposed to be pyxes, intended to hold the chrism, or
by some as designed only for containing pigments or unguents. Two
similar boxes discovered at Lewis are engraved in the Archæologia,
and described as small bronze pyxes;<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> and another found at Lincoln
is figured in the Archæological Journal.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> The remarkably close resemblance
of these to the Scottish example manifestly points to some
common purpose for the whole; and the latter is of special value as
supplying the means which are wanting in the others of making some
approximation to the precise age to which they belong. It was found
about the year 1818, near Dalquharran Castle, in the parish of Daily,
Ayrshire, filled with coins of David II. of Scotland, Edwards I. and II.
of England, and two counterfeit sterlings of the Counts of Flanders
and Porcieu. It is now in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.</p>

<p>Few as are the examples of Scottish ecclesiastical relics which we
can now refer to, they are more than we might reasonably anticipate
in a country where the fanes and altars of the medieval church have
lain in ruins for so many centuries, and even the existence of a single
ruined church pertaining to its primitive Christian era may be still
liable to dispute. Though such remains are of less esteem as sources
of information relative to the periods to which they belong than the
objects of earlier eras, they will not be regarded by the intelligent
historian as altogether devoid of value in relation to the peculiar arts
and customs or the degree of civilisation of ages, concerning which
much obscurity has still to be removed.</p>

of Sir Walter Scott's reading of the original

making sense of it. What he calls "the puzzling

is the Celtic <i>Hi</i>, or island. The concluding
words of the first part, which Sir Walter
renders <i>illdra. ipa</i>, and then extends to

both of derivation and grammar, become
by the simple substitution of an <i>e</i> for an <i>r</i>&mdash;letters
nearly similar in the old Gothic

seen the cup myself, I must leave the
date for determination by some future observer;
but from the character of the lettering
it is probable that it will prove at
least a century later, the <i>ix.</i> being more
likely an <i>m</i>, which would assign it to the
memorable year in which Malcolm, Margaret,
and Edgar died. <i>Vide</i> note E., Lord
of the Isles.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

MISCELLANEOUS ANTIQUITIES.</h3>


<p>The numerous relics which illustrate the arts and manners of the
Medieval Period have already furnished English and foreign antiquaries
with copious materials for large and valuable treatises on single
selected departments, nor is the field of Scottish medieval art greatly
less productive. It is not, however, designed in this closing chapter
to do more than select a few characteristic examples of a very
miscellaneous character, which are worthy of a passing glance in a
treatise on Scottish Archæology, though they pertain to a branch of
the subject which can only be satisfactorily dealt with in detached
monographs. Of medieval personal ornaments it would be vain to
attempt the most cursory enumeration in a closing chapter; but their
value as elements of medieval history is altogether different from
those of the primitive periods heretofore referred to. Whatever exhibits
to us the artistic skill, the ingenuity,
and the personal habits of a past age, cannot
be without interest to the historian; but we
manifestly stand in a very different position in
relation to those accessories of history when
dealing with comparatively recent and literate
ages.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/image677.jpg" width="487" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Gold Ring, Flodden Field.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One branch of medieval art&mdash;the fictile ware&mdash;naturally possesses
peculiar attraction to the Archæologist, as the offspring of the primitive
arts already minutely considered. So far as may be judged of
Scottish medieval pottery from the few examples preserved, it does
not greatly differ from contemporary English fictile ware. One curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
specimen found in 1833 at Perclewan, in the parish of Dalrymple,
Ayrshire, is described as "a pitcher of earthenware like that represented
in prints in the hand of the woman of Samaria, at the
well of Sychar."<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> It is glazed, as is most usual with medieval pottery,
of a greenish colour, and is curiously decorated on the front with
the face and hands of a man in relief. From the description it appears
to bear a close resemblance to a fictile vessel found at the bottom
of an old well, discovered under the foundation of houses in
Cateaton Street, City, London, taken down in 1841.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>Several fine specimens of medieval pottery were dug up a few years
since on the estate of Courthill, in the vicinity of Dalry, Ayrshire,
and are now in the possession of the proprietor, Andrew Crawford,
Esq. Nearly at the same time a remarkable antique sword was discovered
at Courthill. The blade, which was of iron, was so greatly
corroded that only a fragment of it could be removed; but the handle
is of bronze, in the form of a dragon, and is described as characterized
by considerable elegance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/image678.jpg" width="308" height="565" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fragments of pottery, of a similar character to the most abundant
class of early English medieval pottery, were dug up at a considerable
depth, during the progress of excavations
on the Castlehill of Edinburgh
in 1849, for constructing a large reservoir,
but they were unfortunately too
much broken by the workmen to admit
of any very definite idea being formed
of their shape. The annexed woodcut
is from an example in my own possession,
which was dug up a few years since in
the ancient tumular cemetery in the
neighbourhood of North-Berwick Abbey,
East-Lothian. It measures eleven and
a quarter inches in height, and about
five and a half inches in greatest diameter,
and is covered, both externally
and internally, with the usual greenish
glaze, common on contemporary English pottery. Various similar
specimens appear to have been discovered in the same locality, but
in most cases only to be destroyed,&mdash;such coarse earthenware being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>naturally regarded as scarcely worth the trouble of removing. The
example figured here represents a small but very curious specimen of
Scottish fictile ware, in the collection at Penicuick House, of the precise
age of which we have tolerably accurate
evidence. It was found on one
of the neighbouring farms in the year
1792, filled with coins of Alexander III.,
and of Edward I. and II. of England.
It measures only three and three quarters
inches in height; and is perforated
at nearly uniform intervals with holes,
as shewn in the engraving. It is of
rude unglazed earthenware, and is unsymmetrical,
as represented here.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 470px;">

</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 579px;">
<img src="images/image679b.jpg" width="579" height="328" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another class of relics found in considerable numbers at North-Berwick,
as well as in various other districts, are small tobacco
pipes, popularly known in Scotland by the names of <i>Celtic</i> or <i>Elfin</i>
<i>pipes</i>, and in Ireland, where they are even more abundant, as <i>Dane's</i>
<i>pipes</i>. The woodcut represents one of those found at North-Berwick,
the size of the original. To what period
these curious relics belong, I am
at a loss to determine. The popular
names attached to them manifestly
point to an era long prior to that of
Sir Walter Raleigh and the Maiden
Queen, or of the royal author of "A
Counterblast to Tobacco," and the
objects along with which they have been discovered, would also seem
occasionally to lead to similar conclusions, in which case we shall
be forced to assume that the American weed was only introduced as
a superior substitute for older narcotics. Hemp may in all probability
have formed one of these. It is still largely used in the East
for this purpose; but Mr. C. K. Sharpe informs me that even in his
younger days it was common for the old wives of Annandale to smoke
a dried white moss gathered on the neighbouring moors, which they
declared to be much <i>sweeter</i> than tobacco, and to have been in use
before the American weed was heard of. I leave the subject, however,
for further investigation, only adding one or two examples of
the circumstances under which these Elfin pipes have been found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
The ancient cemetery at North-Berwick is in the vicinity of a small
Romanesque building of the twelfth century, and close upon the sea
shore. Within the last fifty years the sea has made great encroachments,
carrying off a considerable ruin, and exposing the skeletons of
the old tenants of the cemetery, along with many interesting relics of
former generations, at almost every spring tide. Notices of similar
discoveries of the Elfin pipe occur in several of the Scottish Statistical
Accounts under various circumstances, but some of them certainly
suggestive of their belonging to a remote era: <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Many of the ancient British encampments appear in the parish [of Kirkmichael,
Dumfriesshire.] Upon some of these being opened ashes have been found, likewise
several broken querns or hand-mills, and in one of them, upon the farm of
Gilrig, with a partition crossing it, and which seems to have been occupied during
later times, there was dug out a sword having a basket-hilt, but so much covered
with rust that it was impossible to form any accurate opinion respecting its antiquity.
There was also seen a number of pipes of burnt clay, with heads somewhat
smaller than that of the tobacco-pipe now in use, swelled at the middle and straiter
at the top."<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> Again,</p>

<p>"Till lately, one of those remarkable monuments of antiquity, called standing
stones, stood at Cairney Mount, (parish of Carluke, Lanarkshire,) but the hope of
finding a hidden treasure induced some rude hand to destroy it. It is supposed to
have stood at the side of a Roman road passing from Lanark across the bridge of
the Mouse beneath Cartland Crags.... A celt or stone hatchet; Elfin-bolts,
(flint and bone arrow-heads); Elfin pipes, (pipes with remarkably small bowls);
numerous coins of the Edwards, and of later date, have been found in the neighbourhood."<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
An example is also noted of the discovery of a tobacco pipe in sinking
a pit for coal at Misk, in Ayrshire, after digging through many feet of sand.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p></div>

<p>Some of the Scottish and Irish Elfin pipes are even smaller than
the example figured above, and seem still better adapted for the recreations
of "the good people" to whom their origin is popularly ascribed.
Others are ornamented with patterns in relief, and many of
them, though not generally of the very smallest size, are stamped
with figures or devices. One example in the possession of Mr. C. K.
Sharpe, found at a depth of many feet on the Castlehill of Edinburgh,
bears the impress of the initials</p>
<div class="center">TB;<br />L</div>
<p>and of upwards of seventy specimens
in the collection of Mr. Bell of Dungannon, some are stamped
R D, and on others are the letters G &#923;, C L,</p>
<div class="center">o<br />oHo,</div>
<p>and I P.</p>

<p>The annexed woodcut represents a still more curious relic, apparently
pertaining to the same class of objects, though greatly more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>primitive in form and construction. It appears to be a tobacco pipe
fashioned in red sandstone in the form of an animal's head, and with the
perforation for inserting the straw or reed by which it must have been
completed, made obliquely through one of the eyes. It was found in
digging a drain at the village of Morningside,
at the base of the Pentland
Hills, where numerous traces of primitive
population have been brought
to light, and was presented to me by
Dr. David Skae, Physician of the
Royal Asylum there. It is figured
here about two-thirds the size of the
original.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 566px;">
<img src="images/image681.jpg" width="566" height="277" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries there is a curious collection
of Irish "Danes' pipes," precisely similar in form to those
found in Scotland. A variety of examples of the same kind, found
both in England and Ireland, are also figured in the Dublin Penny
Magazine,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> along with certain "clay pipe-stoppers, evidently appendages
to pipes with small bowls," but which those who can still remember
the obsolete fashions of the past generation have no difficulty
in recognising as the periwig curlers of much more recent times
than the Danes, if not the Elves! The conclusion arrived at by
the writer in the Dublin Penny Magazine is, that these Danes' pipes
are neither more nor less than tobacco pipes, the smallest of them
pertaining to the earlier years of Queen Elizabeth's reign, when the
rarity and value of tobacco rendered the most diminutive bowl sufficiently
ample for the enjoyment of so costly a luxury. From this he
traces them down to the reign of Charles II., by the increasing dimensions
of the bowl. It is not improbable that these conclusions may
be correct, notwithstanding the apparent indications of a much earlier
origin, which circumstances attendant on their occasional discovery
have seemed to suggest. The following description of a curious Scottish
memorial of the luxury would, however, seem at least to prove
that we must trace the introduction of tobacco into this country to a
date much nearer the discovery of the New World by Columbus than
the era of Raleigh's colonization of Virginia. The grim old Keep
of Cawdor Castle, associated in defiance of chronology with King
Duncan and Macbeth, is augmented, like the majority of such Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>fortalices, by additions of the sixteenth century. In one of the
apartments of this later erection, is a stone chimney, richly carved
with armorial bearings and the grotesque devices common on works
of the period. Among these are a mermaid playing the harp, a
monkey blowing a horn, a cat playing a fiddle, and a fox smoking a
tobacco pipe. There can be no mistake as to the meaning of the last
lively representation, and on the same stone is the date 1510&mdash;the
year in which the wing of the castle is ascertained to have been
built.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/image682.jpg" width="348" height="586" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Ancient Claymore.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The arms and armour are no less characteristic of the medieval
than of earlier periods, and are not without minuter national details
well worthy of note. There was indeed from the very commencement
of the Scottish medieval period in the eleventh century, to the final
disarming of the Highland clans in 1746, two completely diverse
modes of warfare and military accoutrement prevailing in Scotland.
The old Celtic population, occupying for the most part the Highland
fastnesses, retained many of the usages of their forefathers under partially
modified forms, and even in
the decoration of their weapons and
defensive armour preserved the ancient
style, which is still traceable
on the Pictish monuments of Scotland.
Many of the circular Highland
targets of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries present exactly
the same interlaced knotwork as may
be seen on bosses and limbs of early
crosses, and even on relics belonging
to the last Pagan era. A mere
glance, however, at a few characteristic
examples must suffice here; and
among these none is more noticeable
than the old claymore with reversed
guard, which is sculptured on so
many of the ancient tombstones of
Iona and of the Western Isles. In the portrait of James I. of Scotland,
which accompanies the old folio edition of the Scots Acts, the
king bears a weapon of this description. It occurs, however, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span>
tombs of a much earlier period, and is now very rarely to be met
with. One good small example is in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries, and another larger and very fine specimen, the handle of
which is here engraved, is in the valuable collection of W. B. Johnstone,
Esq. The claymore is figured in the sculptures both of Iona
and Oronsay with a considerable variety of details. In some the blade
is highly ornamented, and the handle varies
in form, but all present the same characteristic,
having the guards bent back towards
the blade. A curious variety of this peculiar
form is seen in a fine large two-handed
sword preserved at Hawthornden, the celebrated
castle of the Drummonds, where the
Scottish poet entertained Ben Jonson during
his visit to Scotland in 1619. It is traditionally
affirmed to have been the weapon
of Robert the Bruce, though little importance
can be attached to a reputation which
it shares with one-half the large two-handed
swords still preserved. The handle appears
to be made from the tusk of the narwhal,
and it has four reverse-guards, as shewn
in the cut. The object aimed at by this form of guard doubtless
was to prevent the antagonist's sword from glancing off, and inflicting
a wound ere he recovered his weapon, and in the last example
especially it seems peculiarly well adapted for the purpose. Among
the curious collection of ancient weapons in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries, is a sword the blade of which measures thirty-two and
a half inches long, and has a waved edge, returned a short way over
the back. It was discovered among the ruins of Bog-Hall Castle,
near Biggar, Lanarkshire; while the handle, which is made of the
section of a deer's horn, and is still more remarkable than the blade,
was found at a great depth in a morass, on the property of Sir
Thomas G. Carmichael, Bart., in Tweeddale.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/image684.jpg" width="194" height="635" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The later two-handed sword, though still so familiar to us, is perhaps
the most interesting in an archæological point of view, of all the
military relics pertaining to the Medieval Period. The huge, ponderous,
and unwieldy weapon, seems the fittest emblem that could be
devised, of the rude baron of the thirteenth century, who lived by
"the good old rule" of physical force, and whose hardy virtues&mdash;not
unsuited to an illiterate age&mdash;are strangely mistaken for the evidences
of a chivalry such as later ages have
not seen. Calmly reasoning from this
characteristic heirloom, as we have
done from those of remoter and less
known periods, we discern in it the
evidence of just such hardy, skilless,
overbearing power, as history informs
us was the character of the
medieval baron, before the rise of
the burgher class readjusted the
social balance by the preponderance
of rival interests. The weapon
figured here is a remarkably fine
and unusually large specimen of the
old Scottish two-handed sword, now
in the possession of George Seton,
Esq., representative of the Setons
of Cariston. It measures forty-nine
inches in the blade, five feet nine
inches in entire length, and weighs
seven and a half pounds. But the
chief interest of this old relic arises
from the well-authenticated family
traditions which associate it with the
memory of its first knightly owner,
Sir Christopher Seton of that Ilk,
from whom some of the oldest scions
of the Scottish Peerage have been
proud to trace their descent. He
was married to Christina, sister of
King Robert the Bruce, whom he
bravely defended at the battle of
Methven. He was shortly after
taken prisoner by Edward I., and
basely hanged as a traitor. "So
dear to King Robert was the memory of this faithful friend and
fellow-warrior, that he afterwards erected on the spot where he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
executed a little chapel, where mass was said for his soul."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> Besides
this fine example of a Scottish two-handed sword, may be mentioned
that ascribed to Sir William Wallace, preserved at Dumbarton Castle;
that of Sir John Graham of Dundaff, (slain 1298,) in the possession
of the Duke of Montrose; another "Wallace sword" at Kinfauns
Castle; and other specimens at Talyskir, in the Isle of Rasay; at
Abbotsford; and in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries.</p>

<p>Among the most recent additions to the same collection is another
remarkable weapon, which possesses undoubted historical value, and
may be associated with more confidence
with the great victory of
Robert the Bruce than most of
the relics that bear his name. It
consists of the head of a battle-axe,
of iron, coated with bronze,
which is figured here. It was discovered
in draining the morass at
Bannockburn in 1785, and is considerably
broken on the edge,
evidently from its use upon the mailed panoply of the gallant knights
who fought in that hard-stricken field. It measures eight and a
quarter inches in length, and four and three quarters in height, from
the point to the insertion of the haft.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Battle-Axe, Bannockburn.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Numerous other remarkable specimens of ancient Scottish arms
and armour are preserved both in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries
and in other public and private collections; but a mere reference
to these without copious illustrations could be of little avail to the
antiquary. The Scottish Museum includes a variety of specimens of
the old quarrel-head, or Wallace Bolt, as it is generally termed; ancient
swords, lance and spear heads, cross-bows, daggers, dirks, hunting
knives, and the old Highland Lochaber-axe, with the more
modern fire-arms, and other military accoutrements, including the
singularly complicated purse-clasp, described by Sir Walter Scott as
that of the celebrated outlaw Rob Roy, with four pistols ingeniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span>
concealed in it for defence of the contents of the purse. Still more
recent relics preserve associations with the victors of Prestonpans and
the vanquished of Culloden Moor. But such objects belong perhaps
fully more to the poet than to the archæologist, and are too frequently
employed to add a fictitious interest to collections, the real use and
value of which have yet to be appreciated.</p>

<p>Some remarkable
pieces of ancient
artillery also
figure in Scottish
history, one or
two of which have
escaped the perils
of siege and the
waste of time,
though the most of them live only in the quaint records of Scottish
chroniclers, like the famed Seven Sisters, cast by Robert Borthwick,
the master-gunner of James IV., which did their last Scottish service
on Flodden Field. A better fate has attended the still more celebrated
Mons Meg, whose unwieldy proportions probably proved her
safety, by inducing the impetuous king to leave her behind, when he
carried the flower of Scottish chivalry to that fatal field. The ancient
barrier gateway of Edinburgh Castle, built most probably soon after
the siege of 1572, was surmounted with a curious piece of sculpture,
occupying a long narrow panel, which is chiefly filled with representations
of artillery and munitions of war, and among these Mons
Meg plays a prominent part. The old-fashioned narrow wheel
carriages of the sixteenth century having given place to more substantial
modern artillery waggons, the highly ornamental but narrow
gateway was demolished in the beginning of the present century,
and one-half of its sculptured panel, figured here, now sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>mounts
the entrance to the Ordnance Office in the Castle. At the
left side is the famed Mons Meg&mdash;or, as she is designated in the list
of ordnance delivered to Monk, on the surrender of the Castle in
1650, "<i>The great iron murderer, Muckle Meg</i>"&mdash;mounted, in all probability,
on her "new cradill, with xiii stane of irne graith," which,
as we learn from the Treasurer's accounts, was provided in 1497, not
long after her safe return from the siege of Dumbarton Castle. This
remarkable piece of ordnance is not cast like a modern cannon, but
built of wrought iron hoops and bars, or staves, and with a narrow
fixed chamber in the breach for containing the charge. It appears to
be of enormous strength; but after doing good service for upwards of
two centuries, both in peace and war, it burst on the 29th October
1680, when firing a salute in honour of James, Duke of York, on his
arrival in Edinburgh; an occurrence which, as Fountainhall records,
failed not to be regarded as an evil omen. This mode of fashioning
artillery with separate staves and hoops is the oldest method of which
we have any account, and was probably universally employed on the
first introduction of gunpowder in constructing what our old Scottish
poet designates, in the earliest known allusion to field artillery,
<i>crakys of war</i>. This curious reference of the old metrical historian,
Barbour, is to the first expedition of Edward III. against the Scots
in 1327, and consequently may be accepted as fixing the precise date
of the introduction of artillery into Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Among the specimens of ancient pieces of ordnance in the Scottish
Museum is a curious pair of cannons, built in a similar manner to
Mons Meg, with hoops and staves of iron, bound with copper, measuring
each twenty-nine inches in length, and designed for mounting on
one stock. This double cannon was formerly stationed on the walls
of Wemyss Castle, Fifeshire, and is said to have belonged to the
celebrated Scottish admiral, Sir Andrew Wood of Largo. Double
guns of the same description, mounted on one carriage, are figured in
the beautifully illuminated MSS. of Froissart, believed to have been
executed about the beginning of the fifteenth century. They are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
shewn on wheel carriages among the Scottish artillery at the battle
of Pinkie in a very curious print belonging to the Bannatyne Club,
entitled, "<i>The Englishe victore agaynste the Schottes, by Muskelbroghe,</i>
<i>1547</i>." Another piece of ancient artillery in the Scottish collection
consists of a still more complicated group of cannons of similar construction,
four being mounted on one carriage, and the whole united
by an iron rod at the breach. They are evidently designed to be
fired at once, so as to discharge a broadside on the enemy; and however
tardy and inconvenient the reloading of these pieces may have
been, the first broadside from a park of such artillery must have had
no slight effect on an advancing foe.</p>

<p>The second half of the curious sculptured memorial of ancient Scottish
artillery in Edinburgh, divorced from the group which includes
Mons Meg, on the demolition of the barrier gateway in 1800, lay long
neglected and buried in rubbish. It was at length rescued from impending
destruction, and safely lodged in the Museum of the Scottish
Antiquaries. It includes a singular group of ancient ordnance and
warlike appliances; chamber pieces or patereros, with chambers or
moveable breeches&mdash;frequently used separately for throwing small
shot; bombards, chiefly employed for throwing great stones; a curious
hexagonal cannon of large proportions, constructed, it may be presumed,
of separate bars; hand-cannons, or the earliest class of portable
fire-arms; with lintstocks, shot, barrels of powder, &amp;c. Along with
these are also large guns of symmetrical form, which may be presumed
to represent brass cannon, as the art of casting cannon was introduced
at a much earlier period than the date suggested for the rebuilding of
the barrier gateway, though it is by no means improbable that the
sculpture may have belonged to a still older structure. Cannon are
said to have been cast even in the middle of the fourteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
and a brass cannon is still preserved at Toulouse, made in the year 1438.</p>

<p>One other class of relics, singularly characteristic of medieval customs
and civilisation, includes the instruments both of punishment
and of torture, of which Scotland may lay claim to the questionable
boast of having some peculiarly national examples. At a period when
criminal punishment avowedly assumed the character of retaliation
and revenge, and when torture was recognised as a legitimate means
of eliciting evidence, Scotland was not behind the other countries of
Europe in the full use of both. The execution at Edinburgh, in 1436,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
of the murderers of James I., the poet king, and especially the horrible
scenes attending on the death of Sir Robert Graham and the Earl of
Athole,&mdash;crowned, in fearful mockery, with a red-hot iron diadem as
king of traitors,&mdash;sufficiently illustrate the ferocious spirit which went
hand in hand with medieval chivalry. One of the most curious historical
relics of this class is the Scottish Maiden, employed, so far as
we know, for the first
time in the execution of
some of the inferior agents
in the assassination of
Rizzio. By this instrument
were beheaded the
Regent Morton, Sir John
Gordon of Haddo, President
Spottiswoode, the
Marquis and Earl of Argyle,
and many more of
the noblest and best blood
in Scotland. The Earl
of Argyle is reported to
have said, with a grave
humour worthy of Sir
Thomas More: it was the
sweetest maiden he had
ever kissed. It now forms one of the most remarkable national relics
in the Scottish Museum, having, it may be presumed, performed its
last office as the instrument of death. It is impossible to look without
feelings of peculiar interest upon this ancient Scottish guillotine,
so directly associated with the great of past ages; though the vindictive
spirit which sought at times to give an added ignominy to a
violent death cheated it of the blood of the gallant Kirkaldy, of Montrose
and Warriston, as well as of others of lesser note, who figure in
the Scottish chronicles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Scottish Maiden.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Boots and Thumbkins are two instruments of judicial torture,
especially associated in Scotland with the sufferings of the Covenanters
during the reign of Charles II. Neither of them, however, were invented
so recently. Torture, which the Roman law permitted only
to be used in compelling the evidence of slaves, bore no such limitation
in medieval Europe; and the name of <i>the Question</i>, commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>
applied to it, abundantly shews the direct purpose for which it was employed.
Examples of this barbarous mode of seeking to elicit the truth
are frequently to be met with in the earlier Acts of Sederunt of the
Court of Session: as in a case of suspected perjury, 29th June 1579,
where the King's Advocate produces a royal warrant for examining
"Jhone Souttar, notar, dwelland in Dundee, and Robert Carmylie,
vicar of Ruthwenis, witnes in the action of improbatioun of ane reversioun
of the lands of Wallace-Craigy; and for the mair certane
tryall of the veritie in the said matter, to put thaim in the buttis,
genis, or ony uther tormentis, and thairby to urge them to declair
the treuth." One pair of thumb-screws in the Scottish Museum, of
unusually large size, is said to have been
the instrument employed by the authorities
of the ancient burgh of Montrose
for eliciting confession; and a ruder
pair, of peculiar form, in the Abbotsford
collection, is figured in the illustrated
edition of the Waverley Novels.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Sir
Walter Scott has given fearfully vivid
life, in his "Old Mortality," to the tribunal
of the Scottish Privy Council, where
such horrible appliances were last in
vogue. Happily they too are consigned
to the cabinet of the antiquary, telling of times which are, we may
hope, as truly left behind as the aboriginal Stone Period, with its
primitive arts and superstitions, and its simple sepulchral rites.</p>

</div>

<p>The Scottish <span class="smcap">JOUGS</span> and <span class="smcap">BRANKS</span> are old instruments of punishment,
popularly associated, for the most part, with judicial visitations of a
more homely and less revolting character than those previously referred
to, though not altogether free from sterner associations. The
jougs, which consist of an iron collar attached by a chain to a pillar or
tree, form the corresponding Scottish judicial implement to the English
Stocks: applied, however, not to the legs or arms, but to the neck.
They are still to be met with attached to the porch of our older
village churches, or occasionally to some venerable tree in the surrounding
churchyard, their application having been most frequently
reserved in the olden time for the enforcement of ecclesiastical discipline.
The woodcut represents a fine old pair of jougs, the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>
of Sir William Jardine, Bart., which were found imbedded in a
venerable ash tree, recently blown down, at the churchyard gate,
Applegirth, Dumfriesshire. The tree, which was of great girth, is
believed to have been upwards of three hundred years
old, and the jougs were completely imbedded in its
trunk, while the chain and staple hung down within
the decayed and hollow core. The more usual form
of the jougs is simply a flat iron collar with distended
loops, through which a padlock was passed
to secure the culprit in his ignominious durance.
Along with this may be mentioned a singular and
probably unique relic of old Scottish judicature, preserved
in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries,
to which it was presented in 1784. It consists of
the brass collar of a Scottish slave of the eighteenth
century. The collar is inscribed in accordance with
the terms of the following verdict, which shews that
the case was not singular; and having been dredged
up in the Frith of Forth, it seems sufficiently probable that the unhappy
victim may have chosen death in preference to the doom from
which there was no other release.</p>

<p>"At Perth, the fifth day of December 1701 years, the Commissioners of Justiciary
of the south district, for securing the peace of the Highlands, considering

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span></p>

<p>From another deed of gift, it appears that Donald M'Donald was
bestowed in like manner on John Earl of Tullibardine.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> No doubt
the other two were similarly disposed of by gift, if not by positive
sale&mdash;so very recently was slavery a part and parcel of Scottish law:
feudal customs, and the singular ideas incident to the peculiar social
state of the Highlands, having remained little affected by all the
changes wrought on the Lowland Saxon and the Southron, until the
final overthrow of the clans on Culloden Moor abruptly broke the
traditions of many centuries.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">BRANKS</span> is another Scottish instrument of ecclesiastical punishment,
chiefly employed for the coercion of female scolds, and those
adjudged guilty of slander and defamation. It may be described as
a skeleton iron helmet, having a gag of the same metal, which entered
the mouth and effectually <i>brankit</i> that unruly member&mdash;the tongue.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
It is an instrument of considerable antiquity, and has probably not
unfrequently been employed for purposes of great cruelty, though in
most examples the gag is not designed to wound the mouth, but only
to hold down the tongue. In the Burgh Records of Glasgow, for example,
under date of April 1574, "Marione Smyt and Margaret Huntare"
having quarrelled, they appear, and produce two cautioners or
sureties, "&thorn;at &thorn;ai sal abstene fra stryking of utheris in tyme cuming,
under &thorn;e pane of <span class="smcap">X</span> lib., <i>and gif thai flyte to be brankit</i>."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> One very
complete specimen still preserved at St. Mary's Church, St. Andrews,
is popularly known as the Bishop's Branks, and is usually said to have
been fixed on the head of Patrick Hamilton and of others of the early
Scottish martyrs who perished at the stake during the religious persecution
of James V.'s reign. This tradition, however, is not borne
out by history in the case of Hamilton, and is probably the addition
of a later age, though the instrument may possibly have supplied both
Archbishop and Cardinal Beaton with a ready means of restraining
less confirmed recusants, and thereby nipping the new heresy in the
bud. But the real origin of its present title is to be traced to the use
of it in much more recent times, by Archbishop Sharp, for silencing
the scandal which an unruly dame promulgated openly against him
before the congregation. A view of the Bishop's Branks is given in
the Abbotsford edition of <i>The Monastery</i>, where it is described as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>merly
kept at St. Mary's Church. It still remains there, in the custody
of the sexton, and is regarded with such general interest as is likely
to secure its preservation. The annexed woodcut is drawn from another
example, which was discovered in 1848 behind the oak panelling
in one of the rooms of the ancient mansion of the Earls of Moray,
in the Canongate, Edinburgh.
The term <i>Branks</i>, it may be
added, is also used in Scotland
to designate a rude substitute
for a horse's bridle and
bit, formed most frequently
of a halter and stick. Some
few years since the frightful
instrument represented below
was preserved in the old
steeple at Forfar, where it
bore the name of the <i>Witch's</i>
<i>Branks</i> or <i>Bridle</i>, and is described
in the Old Statistical Account of the parish of Forfar as the
bridle with which the wretched victims of superstition were led to
execution. The field, it is added, where they suffered is pointed out
to strangers as a place of curious interest. The witch's bridle was
carried off from Forfar to add
to the antiquarian treasures of
the late well-known collector
Mr. Alexander Deuchar of Edinburgh.
The date 1661 is
punched on the circle, along
with what seems to read <span class="smcap">Angus</span>
<span class="smcap">s.</span><a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> The object aimed at
in applying so dreadful a gag
to those who were condemned
to the stake as guilty of witchcraft
and dealing with the devil, was not so much the purposed
cruelty which its use necessarily involved, as to prevent the supposed
possessors of such unearthly gifts from pronouncing the potent formula
by means of which it was implicitly believed they could transform
themselves at will to other shapes, or transport themselves where
they pleased, and thus effectually outwit their tormentors. It furnishes
a melancholy index of the barbarism which prevailed in our
own country at so very recent a period, that educated men could be
found to give credit to such follies, or that even among the most
illiterate and rude, executioners could be enlisted to apply to a woman
an instrument the very picture of which is calculated to excite a
shudder.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span></p>
<p>It would not be difficult to add to these common instruments of
punishment and of torture others equally characteristic of the spirit
of the age, though not brought into such general use. Registers of
various kirk-sessions recently printed by the Abbotsford Club, the
Spottiswoode Society, and others of the Scottish literary book clubs,
disclose much curious evidence of the petty tyranny and cruelty too
frequently exercised by these courts in the enforcement of ecclesiastical
discipline, most frequently by means little calculated to promote
reformation or good morals. In these, however, as in the traces of
earlier manners which we have sought to recover, the historian finds
a key to the character of the age to which they belong, and indications
of its degree of advancement in civilisation, such as no contemporary
historian could furnish, since it supplies elements for comparing
and for contrasting the present with the past, no less available than
the rude pottery and the implements of flint or bone which reveal to
us the simple arts of aboriginal races. The great difference in point
of value between the two classes of relics is, that those more recent
indices of obsolete customs supply to us only an additional element
wherewith to test and to supplement the invaluable records which the
printing press supplies, while the latter are the sole chronicles we
possess of ages more intimately associated with our human sympathies
than all the geological periods of the preadamite earth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />

CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>In the two previous chapters, as well as in that devoted to medieval
ecclesiology, some of the later exemplars of Scottish arts and civilisation
have been glanced at, coeval with many authentic historical
documents, to which the researches of the antiquary can only add
supplementary illustrations. These, however, though legitimately
included in the compass of archæological investigations, do not
strictly come within the plan of this work, except in so far as they
suffice to illustrate the remarkable contrast, both in character and
historical value, of the antiquities of the Primitive and Medieval
Periods. Viewing Archæology as one of the most essential means for
the elucidation of primitive history, it has been employed here chiefly
in an attempt to trace out the annals of our country prior to that
comparatively recent medieval period at which the boldest of our
historians have heretofore ventured to begin. The researches of the
ethnologist carry us back somewhat beyond that epoch, and confirm
many of those conclusions, especially in relation to the close affinity
between the native arts and Celtic races of Scotland and Ireland, at
which we have arrived by means of archæological evidence. Of the
six Celtic dialects known, either as living languages or preserved in
books, the Irish and the Scottish Gaelic most nearly approximate,
the former being to a great extent only a cultivated and more artificial
modification of the other. The Manx dialect, though belonging to the
same subdivision, differs much more considerably from both, representing,
it may be assumed, the northern Celtic tongue prior to the
intrusion of the Scoti into Ireland, or their later colonization of Dal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>riada.
Again, the three several dialects of the Celtic idiom of the
ancient Britons, the Welsh, the Cornish, and the Armorican, differ
essentially from all these; thus clearly indicating the early separation
which took place between the Southern Celtic Britons and the
Picts, and the modification of the peculiar characteristics of the
latter by local influences in which the former bore no share. In all
these respects the conclusions of the ethnologist receive not only confirmation
but much minute elucidation from archæological research.
But we have found from many independent sources of evidence, that
the primeval history of Britain must be sought for in the annals of
older races than the Celtæ, and in the remains of a people of whom
we have as yet no reason to believe that any philological traces are
discoverable, though they probably do exist mingled with later dialects,
and especially in the topographical nomenclature, adopted and
modified, but in all likelihood not entirely superseded by later
colonists. With the earliest intelligible indices of that primeval
colonisation of the British Isles our archæological records begin,
mingling their dim historic annals with the last giant traces of elder
worlds; and, as an essentially independent element of historical research,
they terminate at the point where the isolation of Scotland
ceases by its being embraced into the unity of medieval Christendom.</p>

<p>The subdivision of historic periods here indicated is by no means
peculiar to Scotland. The isolation of the elder nations was universal
prior to the diffusion of Christianity. Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon,
Tyre, Judea, Greece, Carthage, and even Rome, each stood solitary
amid its vastest conquests. It was reserved for the Popedom&mdash;that
great fact of medieval history&mdash;to create a unity by means of which
the isolation of the nations came to an end without the sacrifice of
their individuality. But that also was no final stage in the world's
history; and though the shadow of Papal supremacy still lingers as
a medieval relic which has outlived its use, time has developed nobler
elements of unity, in harmony with the true spirit of modern nationality.
In nothing is the practical character of modern scientific discovery
and mechanical skill&mdash;the steam-engine, the railway, the
electric telegraph&mdash;more apparent than in its antagonism to this
antiquated isolation of the nations. Between the modern and the
primeval periods, the medieval era interposes as the long stage of
transition in which the transforming influences of the new faith were
changing the whole social fabric, and moulding it into higher forms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
But as these things of the past have made way for the time which is,
so too must it give place, as a transition time and the precursor of
a still brighter future. The world itself is a transition stage, and
all sublunary things are but the preparatives for a mightier futurity.
Viewed as a part of the great cosmical history of which geology has
recovered so many chapters, the labours of the archæologist seem to
add but a few stray leaves. The strata of the earth's crust, deep as
we can penetrate, or lofty as we may climb, are filled with the evidences
of the organic life of preadamite orders of being; but it is only
in the latest diluvial superficies that we detect those traces of our
own race, which thus so unmistakably announce that man is but of
yesterday. If, however, the isolated individuality of the elder nations
of the world's history confers on each of them an interest which
we seek for in vain in those of the medieval era of transition, man
also has a peculiar individuality which gives a value to the most
perishable relics he casts behind him in his brief lifetime. To the
geologist one perfect example is a certain type of its species, and
hence a complete geological collection is a conceivable thing; but it
is not so with the labours of the archæologist. He aims at recovering
a clue to the esoteric no less than to the exoteric indices of past
generations, and sees in each varied relic the product of human
thought, invention, and intelligent design. Each human being of all
the past ages, born into time as an immortal being, had a personality
and a destiny which give to whatever traces may he recoverable of
him an interest for all time. Minutest variations may be the fruits
and evidence of a mental labour never repeated, and each device of
fancy or caprice may contain a clue to the character of the individual
mind,&mdash;a reflex, as it were, of the individuality, of the psychical
physiognomy of its originator. If we except, indeed, the treasures of
the numismatist,&mdash;which are, strictly speaking, a branch of written
history,&mdash;there are no true duplicates in the collection of the archæologist.
His researches are conducted in a boundless field, since their
novelty is as inexhaustible as the phases of human thought. Nor
can the archæologist forget, while thus reviewing his own study as a
branch of human knowledge, and seeking for it its just place among
the Sciences, that he is little likely to overestimate the dignity of a
pursuit which embraces within its aim the primal history of man.</p>

<p>The geologist, devoutly scanning the records of earlier Creation,
traces onward the development of higher organizations, not as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
embryonic life, passing by some innate or self-generated law of
vitality from the f&#339;tal and immature to more perfect and higher
states of being, but as successive ideas of the Divine Creator
thought out into a recorded actuality; while each, by its embryonic
organization, or by its manifestations of the lower nature of a preliminary
and imperfect dispensation, reveals the mind of the Creator,
and purposely foreshadows the "better things to come." Literal
types are these, but shadows also pointing onward from the first days
in that uterine week of Creation when the Spirit of God moved on
the face of the deep, and the formless and the void became instinct
with successive orders of being, until at length man was made in the
Divine image, and God rested from his work. Into the original
moral condition of that most perfect fruit of Creation thus born in
the fulness of time, it is not our province here to enter. Archæology,
in a peculiar sense, deals with man mortal, not immortal&mdash;with
man not as he was made at first, "upright," but as the seeker out of
"many inventions;" and as such he too appears to us, like the elder
offspring of Creation, in an embryonic state, from which we follow him
upward step by step until we recognise in the present an harvest of
all the past. The Archaic Period presents, indeed, as one of its most
peculiar characteristics, the abundance of native gold, but the true
<span class="smcap">GOLDEN AGE OF MAN</span> lies before him, not behind. Some nations do
appear from the very dawn of history possessed of a singularly developed
civilisation. Such, however, was indispensable to the existence
of any history not purely mythic or archæological; while in the
very oldest of these we discover also the traces of a still earlier embryonic
period through which they have passed.</p>

<p>A general system of Archæology remains as yet a desideratum.
Egypt stands alone in its strange old civilisation, as if, Minerva-like,
it had sprung forth at once a maiden nation, endowed with arts,
polity, and an organized social system; but even its unwritten history,
we have seen, retains the traces of an ante-historic Stone Period&mdash;a
childhood in common with the world's younger commonwealths.
Heretofore, however, the infancy of nations has been, for the most
part, contentedly left in the wrappages of their first swaddling myths.
Of Asia our knowledge of its primitive archæology is only by means
of the merest fragmentary and isolated data, which can piece into no
coherent system. India and China reveal much that illustrates the
maturity of an elder and superseded period, but nothing as yet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>
takes hold of the beginnings of things. Nineveh and Babylon have
recently yielded up strange and most interesting records of the past;
but the more minutely we investigate these, the less reason we find
for imagining that they pertain to the infancy of Asiatic nations.
The primeval archæology of Asia remains yet to be explored. It
must not be sought for among the deserted scenes of barbaric pomp
and oriental magnificence, on the banks of the Tigris or the Euphrates,
but in the northern steppes, and on the less hospitable heights, and
the outlying valleys which skirt the seats of elder empire. There
truths of the deepest importance in relation to the history of man
still lie recorded in undeciphered annals. There only can we hope to
find the types which have been repeated, with endless variations, by
the later wanderers, not only into Europe, but throughout the diverse
regions of the New World. When this branch of knowledge has been
thoroughly explored, we shall possess a new argument for the unity
of the human race, not less conclusive than any which the ingenious
learning of the philologist has supplied. Of another chapter in the
progress of man, bearing more directly on the elucidation of the antehistorical
period of Europe, that of the north-western migration from
central Asia, a comprehensive general system of archæology has yet
much to reveal. We owe to the Asiatic researches of Humboldt a clear
understanding of the systems of mountain chains, both of Europe and
Asia, which have exercised so important an influence on the distribution
of the entire Fauna of the two continents. A remarkable
simplicity of structure is discernible in the arrangement of the continuous
lines of greatest elevation, which strikingly coincides with
the traces we can recover of the route pursued by the successive nomadic
waves of population which have passed from Asia to Europe.
These chains of abrupt elevation, which appear to have served as
natural tracts, within the defined limitations of which the nomade
races were urged onward by as natural a law as the river is borne
seaward in its channel, are composed of four great systems of mountains,
almost uniformly directed from west to east, and parallel with
the greatest length of the continent. These are the Altai, the Thianshan,
the Kuenlun, and the Himalaya. A glance at the map of
Asia, and especially at the admirable physical charts prepared by Mr.
Alexander Keith Johnston, shews with singular precision the courses
of continuous migration, the localities where mountain barriers arrested
for a time some portion of the migrating nomades, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>
eddies of a stream, and the vast yet isolated steppes in which they
may be assumed to have settled down for ages, and become the centres
of later migratory offshoots, tending ever to the north-east. Tracing
again the influence of the geographical features of the old world at
the imaginary line of separation between Europe and Asia, we discern
the physical causes of known historical facts. We see the inevitable
course of the old patriarchal tribes, from the table-land of Iran,
and the great Asiatic peninsulas beyond, directly to Asia Minor and
the narrow Straits of the Dardanelles, while the table-land of Syria
and Arabia is shut in to the western shores of Palestine, the seat of
Tyre and of Judea. Northward of this the Caspian Sea seems placed
as it were to exclude the wanderers for a time from their final settlements.
South of it a narrow shore appears to be the appointed
channel by which one early stream passed along the continuous line
of the Kuenlun chain to the base of the Caucasus, and from thence
reached the ancient scenes of Pelasgian colonization. But it is by
the wider gorge, to the north of the Caspian Sea, that the great nomadic
tide must have flowed, while we see there the Ural chain
stretching southward to limit the European portal of colonization,
and to arrest and detain the wanderers who pursued a more northerly
course. Herein, therefore, may be discovered the geographical elements
in which important ethnological distinctions have had their
rise, while at the same time the archæologist discovers in it an additional
motive for pursuing his researches into the primitive antiquities
of the great northern Asiatic steppes, where the true key to the
sources of European primeval archæology, we cannot doubt, is yet to
be found.</p>

<p>Of this comprehensive system of antehistorical research the Archæology
of Scotland forms the merest fractional item. It is indispensable,
however, for the integrity of the whole; and as I believe that it
is not at Babylon or Nimrud, but in the northern steppes of Asia, that
the primeval history of the elder continent must be sought, so also it
is not in the annals of Greece or Rome, or in the antiquities of the
adjacent kingdoms, modified by their arts and arms, but in Ireland,
Scotland, and the Scandinavian countries, that we may hope to recover
the unadulterated first chapters of European history. The
precise conclusions to which we have been led, in relation to Scottish
Archæology, are such as amply accord with this idea. The Celtæ,
we have seen reason to believe, are by no means to be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
the primal heirs of the land, but are on the contrary comparatively
recent intruders. Ages before their migration into Europe, an unknown
Allophylian race had wandered to this remote island of the
sea, and that in its turn gave place to later Allophylian nomades,
also destined to occupy it only for a time. Of these antehistorical
nations Archæology alone reveals any traces. Hitherto both the
historian and the ethnologist have ascribed their remains to the later
Celtæ, the first historical race of Northern Europe, introducing
thereby confusion and cumulative error into all reasoning on their
data. These elements of history can only be rectified and properly
adjusted when the primitive archæology of the various countries of
Europe has been sifted and treated in detail, and when each subdivision
has been traced to its origin, and most probably to its Asiatic
source. We need not doubt that an abundant phalanx of workers
will ere long be found enlisted in this interesting field of research.
The mere gathering of curious rarities commanded but a limited sympathy,
while their possession was the sole end to be attained, and the
gratification of an impassive acquisitiveness superseded the search for
truth. The fossil encrinite or the "witch bead"<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> was equally singular
and valueless, so long as it was merely an incomprehensible <i>lusus</i>
<i>naturæ</i>. But when it came to be recognised as the index to the
history of a whole genus of radiated polyps, both recent and fossil,
it was taken from the novelties of the curiosity-hunter, and permanently
classified among the illustrations of natural science. It were
easy to shew why it is that we have been slower in turning to account
the no less manifest illustrations of the history of the <i>Bimana</i>, first
order in the class of mammals. Some of the sources of this tardy
recognition of their value have already been glanced at; but it is sufficient
that we are now learning to discover their true use, and are at
length aiming at the recovery of a just view of man as a rational and
immortal creature, by means of the perishable trappings which he
throws off behind him, in his passage across this probationary stage
of being. We are all conscious of passionate longings after a knowledge
of the past, no less than of an instinctive desire to search into
the future. Man "looks before and after," he feels himself no isolated
being, but one link in a vast chain, the ends of which stretch away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>immeasurably into the past and the future; and while he discovers
in the preadamite periods of creation a preparatory dispensation, he
recognises in his own period a more perfect one, not because he conceives
it to be final, but because he knows it to be probationary, and
the preliminary to that which is perfect. Thus, by thoughts in
which the antiquary dwells on the yet undeveloped designs of the
Ancient of Days, does he perceive a new dignity and sacredness in
pursuits which not the ignorant only have heretofore deemed puerile
and worthless, recognising in them the means of recovering lost links
in that chain by which such mighty truths depend. He looks upon the
shadowy past by the clearer light of the future; and while the revelation
of "life and immortality" adds a new force to his convictions
of the unity which pervades creation, and is manifested in Providence,
it also stimulates with a more lively energy his desire to lay hold
upon "the evidence of things not seen."</p>
